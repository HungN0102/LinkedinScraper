You will receive £43,292 the band minimum. Progress to the band maximum of £47,380 will be via incremental progression. Location: Southwark This is an exciting opportunity to become a Software Developer, in a small but effective team, producing unique technology solutions to solve business issues relating to some of the more specialist and sensitive parts of the MPS and National Policing. Why join us? You’ll be joining a highly innovative, enthusiastic, supportive, and inclusive team creating bespoke software solutions and technical demonstrators. The team has a varied skillset and performs a range of functions from exploring new off-the shelf technologies, taking commercially available products and modifying them, and where a solution does not exist, developing a solution or undertaking research activities with academia. Our team specialises in being able to rapidly deliver, and then support, tailored technical solutions to meet immediate operational requirements. Your responsibilities will be varied and will involve being trusted to work on your own, or cooperating effectively and efficiently with a larger project team, managing both tasks and team members. We’re mostly office based, with occasional approved working from home. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion The MPS is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all MPS Staff share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the capital’s hardest problems.

Who we are:  Technology, Research and Innovation (TRI) are part of Operational Technology within the Met Operations 3 command and are responsible for keeping the MPS at the forefront of new and emerging technologies. This is achieved by undertaking research and development of innovative solutions for operational and corporate MPS customers, including Counter Terrorism. The work is highly innovative and may involve undertaking research activities with academia, exploring new off-the shelf technologies, taking commercially available products and modifying them or where a solution does not exist, creating it. This may be through development of bespoke IT hardware/software/electronic solutions or a combination of these. We specialise in being able to rapidly deliver tailored technical solutions to meet immediate operational requirements. You’ll be joining the IT section, who develop bespoke IT solutions to unique business needs relating to some of the more specialist and sensitive parts of the MPS and national policing network. Delivery of these solutions involves the complete lifecycle from developing requirements with customers, producing design solutions, and turning these designs into fully functional products or systems for operational use in the field. Some of these systems require on-going support due to their specialist or short term nature, whereas other systems will be required to be transitioned into other areas of the business. We work closely with the Electronics Systems Development, Research, and Explore sections of TRI as well as Digital Policing and other MPS technology departments. What you will be doing:  You’ll be developing bespoke and specialised software solutions and technical demonstrators for use in the field, working together with customers to ensure and increase the safety and trust of Londoners. Many of the projects are high value and high impact. The projects are normally transformational and require change within the business area in tandem with the delivery of new capabilities. You’ll be co-operating and collaborating with other members of the development team, or trusted to work on your own, as part of the full development process. We give you the time and space to nurture your interests, and you’ll be surrounded by a warm and inclusive team who will share your enthusiasm for technology.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location. 
Requirements 
Security clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance. 
To apply, please include the following: 
An updated resume / CV 
Thoughtful responses to our application questions 
Offer Deadline 
In an effort to build more transparency into our recruitment process, we’d like to share our offer deadline expectations. By applying to this position, you commit to confirming your decision within two weeks of receiving your written offer. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Increasing prices, stagnant wages, high rents, and insufficient housing stock have put homeownership permanently out of reach for too many. 
We are on a mission to transform the housing market: We’re broadening access to homeownership for aspiring first-time buyers, simplifying the home-buying process, and promoting our customers’ financial wellbeing through the smarter management of their home finances. Backed by leading investors along with a cohort of top angel investors, we’re set for an exceptional 2022. 
The challenge is huge and we are looking for passionate people with diverse skills and backgrounds to add to our rapidly growing team. And that’s where you come in: 
 
About the role: 
So far, we’ve built a new type of digital lender focused on helping individuals get on the housing ladder. Next, we’re building a SaaS platform that will allow us to offer our game-changing products powered by the finance of various lenders. 
This platform will enable us to offer the best products at market-beating prices, putting more first time buyers into homes. We’re also building a conveyancing team, loan sizing and credit strategy automation, improving our accounting system and developing our insurance products. These plans need exceptional software engineers interested in fixing a large, broken market in the following ways: 
Working cross-functionally : We work in small, cross-functional teams with occasional ops and commercial team members. You will work closely with other teams to understand customer pain points and create solutions. 
Product development : Our engineers work on the end to end delivery of our products. This approach includes identifying opportunities to help get our customers into homes, building solutions, rollout, learning from our progress and iterating. 
Full-stack development : We work across the stack in many capacities, including web development, integrating partner solutions, customer application flows, backend accounting systems, tools for our operational teams, building APIs and much more. 
 
Requirements: 
We look for Software Engineers who: 
Have a few years of backend/full-stack commercial experience building software products. 
Care deeply about customers: we measure our success by how many people we bring into homes. If you're excited about solving customer problems, let us know! 
Are great to get along with: If you're a team player, we'd love to hear from you. 
Are open to different technologies and tasks: Our engineering team is available to diverse coding backgrounds if you're willing to play with Ruby on Rails, React and TypeScript. 
Look for hybrid work with 1-2 days a week on-site.
 
 Nice to have: 
Experience using Ruby on Rails, React and TypeScript. 
In-house experience building and iterating on customer-focused products.

This role is open only to recent or soon-to-be graduates of coding academies and coding boot camps, and/or career switchers looking for entry-level development roles. 
As a software engineer at Softwire, you’ll be part of a bright, inclusive, supportive team, working directly with our customers to solve some of their biggest challenges. You could be involved in anything from large-scale digital transformations to artificial intelligence, making a genuine difference to people’s lives, businesses and society along the way. 
Interspersed with the project work, you’ll benefit from structured training that equips you for a long and fulfilling career in the digital world. Working here, your opportunities are virtually limitless, with a wide variety of career paths open to you. In fact, both our current and our previous managing directors are alumni of our graduate programme. 
Our coding academy graduate timeline: What to expect? 
Months 1-2:  Software engineering induction 
Our training programme gets you up-to-speed with the skills you need to thrive as a professional digital engineer. You’ll get a grounding in coding, source control, modern technology stacks, and more. You’ll then form a team with your fellow graduates to develop a piece of software, typically for a not-for-profit organisation or to be used within Softwire. Under the guidance of experienced engineers, you’ll learn what it takes to deliver commercial-grade software. 
Months 3-15:  Working on client projects 
With your first project complete, you’ll join one of our teams delivering a client project, usually in our offices but sometimes on a customer site. You’ll get plenty of support throughout, surrounded by helpful colleagues and industry experts to answer all your questions. And with continual peer review of your work, your software engineering skills will quickly rise to new levels. Alongside your project work, you’ll continue to attend our in-house training programme with your fellow graduates. This industry-leading course lasts six weeks in total, spread over 12 months. It broadens your knowledge in key aspects of professional software engineering, including: 
System design 
Development methodologies 
Additional technologies

We continue to invest in your development and promote from within. Many of our senior staff joined as graduates and have followed a range of career paths. And, as the individuals we’ve highlighted below show, you’ll quickly get opportunities to take on added responsibility. You might decide you love leading project delivery. You might enjoy overseeing a technology team. You may find consulting is your passion. You could choose to specialise in areas such as design, or data science and artificial intelligence. 
The people we’re looking for: 
A passion for solving real-world challenges: First and foremost, you’ll get a buzz from building things that make a difference to businesses, people and society. We also want to see passion for coding – any experience you have is a bonus 
An articulate people-person: You’ll be interacting with a wide variety of individuals: some deeply techy, some from complex business domains, and others with low digital literacy. You’ll need to be comfortable understanding their needs and discussing potentially complicated technical ideas with all of them 
A positive, can-do team player: You love pushing the team to greater heights by helping colleagues out wherever you can. You always look to improve yourself and others. Your default answer to a question is ‘yes’, and you make big problems seem small 
Application process and start dates: 
We know how much effort you put into your application, so we always aim to get back to you within two working days at each stage. And if you get to the interviews, you can choose your own timeslots, using our online booking system. Given the current situation, we’ll be running this year’s recruitment process entirely remotely. 
Start date: Nov. '22 
Benefits package - at-a-glance: 
Starting salary of £40,000 
50% of company profits paid as bonus to employees 
25 days annual holiday with the option to buy or sell, plus charity days 
Generous maternity, paternity and adoption pay 
Consistently one of the best places to work in the UK (We’ve been in the Best Companies To Work For list 10 years in a row)

At Palantir, we're passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use their data. Our technology has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir's platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you'll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You'll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world's most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you'll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
Our Principles
 Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.

Please speak to your recruiter about the working pattern that works best for you. 
Location: UK - London, with ability to work remote

A hugely diverse range of clients rely on us to deliver the kind of change that adds genuine, lasting value to their business. 
Personal independence 
Regulation and controls are standard practice in our industry and Deloitte is no exception. These controls provide important legal protection for both you and the firm. We are subject to a number of audit regulations, one of which requires that certain colleagues abide by specific personal independence constraints. This can mean that you and your ""Immediate Family Members"" are not permitted to hold certain financial interests (shares, funds, bonds etc.) with audit clients of the firm. The recruitment team will provide further detail as you progress through the recruitment process.

 Being a Leader at Deloitte 
Cultural fit and purpose-led leadership is crucial for Deloitte. Our leaders always set the example and inspire their colleagues. They make quality time for people and take an interest in them.

For the first stage, you will be invited to undertake a coding course which will take around an hour a day or you can complete in one or more sessions within a limited timeframe. You will be sent instructions on how to do this and do not need to have any previous experience of coding. You then complete a questionnaire about your reasons for wanting to undertake the apprenticeship and start a career as a software tester.
 
 
The second part of the selection with the training provider will be a coding challenge, which will take around an hour to complete. On completion and if successful you will then be contacted by a member of the Makers to team for an interview.
 
 
The final stage will be an interview with DWP Digital to assess behaviours and skills. Here you will be assessed on the Behaviours Working Together and Changing and Improving and you will be required to complete a 10-minute presentation. Further details will be provided when selected for interview.

A reserve list may be held for a period of 6 months from which further appointments can be made.
 
 
Reserve list candidates will be posted in merit order by location.
 
 
You must meet the security requirements before you can be appointed. The level of security needed is security check.
 
 
For meaningful checks to be carried out individuals you will need to have lived in the UK for a sufficient period of time, to enable appropriate checks to be carried out and produce a result which provides the required level of assurance. Whilst a lack of UK residency in itself is not necessarily a bar to a security clearance, and expectation of UK residency may range from 3 to 5 years. Failure to meet the residency requirements needed for the role may result in the withdrawal of provisional jobs offers.
 
 
Any move to DWP from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may however be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility at here

This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant’s details held on the IFD will be refused employment.
 
 
A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.

YouGov is an international research data and analytics group. 
We help the world’s most recognised brands, media owners and agencies to plan, activate and track better marketing activities. As pioneers of online market research, we have been building an ever-growing source of consumer data for the past twenty years. Creating the richest and most complete understanding of your customers’ complex lives. We call it living data. 
We are driven by a set of shared values. We are fast, fearless and innovative. We work diligently to get it right. We are guided by accuracy, ethics and proven methodologies. We respect and trust each other, and bring these values into everything that we do. Unlike our competitors, we understand how opinions and trends change from day-to-day, week-to-week and year-to-year. That’s why we have built a platform that gets you right to the source for reliable, accurate data that reflects the reality of a complicated world. Imagine if you could know what 17 million+ people in over 55 markets were thinking now? Or last week? And do so again and again? That’s why we’re different. 
Rather than commissioned research that’s already out-of-date by the time it reaches someone’s inbox, our data is alive. So, no matter how quickly things change, our clients are always in the know. 
YouGov. Living Consumer Intelligence. 
The Culture 
Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to YouGov. We are committed to giving the world a voice by capturing the opinions of all groups, including the ones that are often under-represented in research.

None of the above can be done without having a truly diverse workforce, in an inclusive workplace. We are very keen on attracting and retaining the best talent. And best talent also means a diverse pool of talent, with various backgrounds and perspectives. 
Supporting the wellbeing of our staff, including maintaining a good work and life balance, is important to us. We support flexible working arrangements where appropriate for a role, with many locations offering a hybrid office-and-remote working approach.

We built the system that runs the BBC Live Events websites, sharing content from Glastonbury, the Reading and Leeds festivals, and the BBC Proms. We’ve been the long-term digital partner for David Lloyd Leisure, building its mobile app, booking system and numerous other capabilities. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Find out what else we’ve been involved with.

We’re working hard to nurture a diverse, inclusive and supportive culture, where people love what they do and feel inspired by working with some of the best minds in the business. We also have a generous budget for a varied programme of staff events and activities, with employees, not management, deciding how the money is spent.

Software Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them. 
Who We Are Looking For: 
 You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. 
You are a broadly skilled engineer, interested in developing web services and building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers. 
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making. 
You work with confidence and without ego. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. 
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. 
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
 
 Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location. 
Requirements 
Security clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems. 
The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration. 
You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level. 
Technologies We Use 
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. 
TypeScript and React are central to our front-end development. 
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library. 
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand. 
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub. 
What We Value 
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work. 
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems. 
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building. 
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. 
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. 
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. 
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points. 
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use: 
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github 
Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them. 
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data. 
Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial but not necessary. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
 
 Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how.

Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location.

At Palantir, we're passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use their data. Our technology has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir's platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you'll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You'll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world's most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you'll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
Our Principles
 Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

Limejump is a technology platform that manages a large renewable energy network. Our portfolio delivers clean energy to businesses and homes, using renewables and stored energy when it’s needed to meet demand. 
We connect and manage 100% renewable energy through the intelligent control of renewable generators, such as wind turbines and solar panels. We work closely with renewable asset owners, buying their energy and then selling it onto the UK’s grid, giving them simple access to the power market. But, the sun isn’t always shining and the wind isn’t always blowing. We must therefore capture energy for times when there is high demand. By harnessing big data and renewable technology, we accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.
 About the role: 
As a member of the scheduling team, you would be working at the heart of the Limejump platform. The team’s focus is to aid Limejump’s scaling ambitions by automating the translation of traded market positions into instructions for assets such as batteries. 
You will be joining an enthusiastic team of 3 people who enjoy what they do. Alongside delivering clean, well tested, understandable code you would be spending time getting into the finer details of the energy industry domain. The team regularly spends time together understanding the ins and outs of National Grid services systems that balance energy supply and demand. 
This team regularly must solve problems that are unsolved elsewhere. The changes required to decarbonise the UK power grid are immense, and we need a lot of intelligent software to do this. One example of these unsolved problems is getting hundreds of individual batteries to behave with the same stability as a large coal fired power plant. 
The team has a commitment to continuous improvement. They hold regular retrospectives, participate in blameless postmortems and hold a regular developer session where they address how they are advancing towards the goal of quality working software. 
 
You will: 
Work closely with the product owner to understand requirements 
Understand end-user needs and develop software solutions 
Continuously improve existing solutions for greater performance and flexibility 
Deliver quality software by ensuring testing is in place 
Collaborate with other developers to design systems and write code
 
 Essential requirements: 
Desire and willingness to learn about the energy industry domain in detail 
A passion for Limejump's vision of a sustainable future, and a commitment to our values 
Experience with Python 
Open and collaborative attitude with a desire to help others 
Happy to build software in an agile way
 
 Desirable skills and experience: 
Postgres or some experience with relational databases 
Understanding of container-based architecture – e.g. Docker and container orchestrators such as Kubernetes 
Go or willingness to learn Go 
Django 
Worked with CI/CD practises 
Interest or willingness to learn TDD 
Experience within the energy industry 
£1k annual innovation budget to spend on self development coupled with 10% time off work to do it 
Private Medical Insurance with AXA PPP with £0 annual excess 
25 days annual leave…and one extra day for your birthday 
Flexible working options to suit your personal life (including caring responsibility and/or your cultural background)

Company wide lunch n learns, culturally diverse celebrations and other social events 
Parental leave – up to 12 weeks paid maternity, adoption and shared parental leave 
Subsidised onsite gym membership and weekly fitness classes 
Cycle to Work Scheme – enjoy a carbon free commute on us! 
Life assurance and personal accident insurance 
Other perks and Culture 
In addition to the listed benefits above, day-to-day life at Limejump is packed full of perks. There is flexibility to split your working week between home and office as well as flexible working hours to allow for balancing work with personal responsibility and circumstances. In the office we have ample comfortable breakout and booth spaces to promote a collaborative working environment. We have a pool table, regularly stocked snacks and drinks, casual working attire and the option to occasionally bring your best fur friend into work with you. 
On top of this we have regular company, department, and team socials to bond with colleagues outside of day-to-day work.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems. 
The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration. 
You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level. 
Technologies We Use 
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. 
TypeScript and React are central to our front-end development. 
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library. 
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand. 
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub. 
What We Value 
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work. 
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems. 
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building. 
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. 
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. 
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. 
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points. 
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use: 
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github 
Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them. 
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data. 
Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial but not necessary. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems.

At Palantir, we're passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use their data. Our technology has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir's platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you'll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You'll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world's most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you'll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team.

Our application includes: Patient medical record system Comprehensive consultation suite Document management Scheduling Accounting Email Social network Task management Referral management Reporting and query system for analytics Clinical text analysis using NLP Collaboration system Practice networking Patient portal Occupational health portal PACS system (MRI/X-ray/Ultrasound) And much more… We have a very relaxed working environment that is more akin to a start-up than a company that’s been running since 2004. We have a team of 20 + developers who are very capable and committed which work in our very collaborative environment. Obviously with web-application development there’s a reasonable amount of CRUD work, that’s a given. But we have also developed interesting in-house tech of our own (distributed databases for document storage, natural language processing for clinical text parsing, UI frameworks, DSLs, language-ext, and echo-process, to name a few). We run on our own machines in high-security data-centres as well as hosting some systems in Azure. We have Infrastructure and Site Reliability Engineers that work closely with the Developers on deployments and monitoring. The people we need are ‘self starters’ and are happy to work on any part of the stack, from UI, to back-end, to data-centre automation, services etc. You must be prepared to develop code using the functional paradigm – this is super important! We need creatively minded individuals who can solve unique problems; not just with code problems, but in improving healthcare too. We need programmers than can hear a real world problem and think creatively and with empathy for the end user. You should have significant C# and web-development experience. Haskell and F# experience is useful but not essential. We have a number of micro-services and libraries written in F# and will be implementing some of our new key architecture in Haskell. If you don’t have functional language experience, you will be expected to learn and use it (the core application is C#, so that will give you time to get up to speed anyway). We encourage Developers to share their knowledge with the rest of the team and run book clubs and presentations to facilitate this. We value career progression for individual contributors and have a number of Developers that now hold Principal Software Engineer positions, you don’t have to become a manager to be promoted here. If you know Language-Ext (and understand why it exists) then that will help, as we use it throughout the ecosystem to bring robustness. SQL Server is our primary database solution, so experience with that is essential – but we also use Postgres. If you have any Postgres experience that would be valuable. Ideally you will be degree educated, but what we do want to see is experience and a passion for what you do. Github projects are incredibly helpful for that, but any examples of work are also valuable. Written and spoken English must be good and you must be a UK resident and have the right to work in the UK. Skills & requirements:  Significant experience in C# and evidence of a varied career in software development. Desirable:  Haskell or F# experience (or any functional language). A willingness to use the functional language paradigm rather than OO. SQL Server / any relational database experience. Web application development experience. Company benefits:  We offer competitive salaries for all of our roles and have an employee profit share scheme. Our working environment is friendly and comfortable. Our working hours are 9am - 5.30 pm with an hour for lunch. You will not be expected to work extremely long hours, as so often happens in software companies. We prefer the approach of 'it's a marathon not a sprint', so we actively discourage working grueling hours. Ad-hoc home working is also a part of our working culture as we understand the need for flexibility. Here are our benefits that you can enjoy: Life Assurance (4X salary). Subsidised gym membership. Private healthcare (length of service conditions apply). Adhoc and scheduled social events. Beverages plus fruit and biscuits available for peckish moments in the office! Quarterly town hall meetings with drinks and snacks. Opportunities to get involved with our 'culture committee'. Optional participation in charity events. Medical Management Systems is an equal opportunities employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability status.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems. 
The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration. 
You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level. 
Technologies We Use 
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. 
TypeScript and React are central to our front-end development. 
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library. 
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand. 
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub. 
What We Value 
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work. 
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems. 
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building. 
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. 
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. 
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. 
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points. 
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use: 
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github 
Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them. 
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data. 
Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial but not necessary. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems.

At Palantir, we're passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use their data. Our technology has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir's platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you'll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You'll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world's most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you'll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
Our Principles
 Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

Limejump is a technology platform that manages a large renewable energy network. Our portfolio delivers clean energy to businesses and homes, using renewables and stored energy when it’s needed to meet demand. 
We connect and manage 100% renewable energy through the intelligent control of renewable generators, such as wind turbines and solar panels. We work closely with renewable asset owners, buying their energy and then selling it onto the UK’s grid, giving them simple access to the power market. But, the sun isn’t always shining and the wind isn’t always blowing. We must therefore capture energy for times when there is high demand. By harnessing big data and renewable technology, we accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.
 About the role: 
As a member of the scheduling team, you would be working at the heart of the Limejump platform. The team’s focus is to aid Limejump’s scaling ambitions by automating the translation of traded market positions into instructions for assets such as batteries. 
You will be joining an enthusiastic team of 3 people who enjoy what they do. Alongside delivering clean, well tested, understandable code you would be spending time getting into the finer details of the energy industry domain. The team regularly spends time together understanding the ins and outs of National Grid services systems that balance energy supply and demand. 
This team regularly must solve problems that are unsolved elsewhere. The changes required to decarbonise the UK power grid are immense, and we need a lot of intelligent software to do this. One example of these unsolved problems is getting hundreds of individual batteries to behave with the same stability as a large coal fired power plant. 
The team has a commitment to continuous improvement. They hold regular retrospectives, participate in blameless postmortems and hold a regular developer session where they address how they are advancing towards the goal of quality working software. 
 
You will: 
Work closely with the product owner to understand requirements 
Understand end-user needs and develop software solutions 
Continuously improve existing solutions for greater performance and flexibility 
Deliver quality software by ensuring testing is in place 
Collaborate with other developers to design systems and write code
 
 Essential requirements: 
Desire and willingness to learn about the energy industry domain in detail 
A passion for Limejump's vision of a sustainable future, and a commitment to our values 
Experience with Python 
Open and collaborative attitude with a desire to help others 
Happy to build software in an agile way
 
 Desirable skills and experience: 
Postgres or some experience with relational databases 
Understanding of container-based architecture – e.g. Docker and container orchestrators such as Kubernetes 
Go or willingness to learn Go 
Django 
Worked with CI/CD practises 
Interest or willingness to learn TDD 
Experience within the energy industry 
£1k annual innovation budget to spend on self development coupled with 10% time off work to do it 
Private Medical Insurance with AXA PPP with £0 annual excess 
25 days annual leave…and one extra day for your birthday 
Flexible working options to suit your personal life (including caring responsibility and/or your cultural background) 
Mental wellbeing support with Mental Health First Aiders and Employee Assistance Programme 
Company wide lunch n learns, culturally diverse celebrations and other social events 
Parental leave – up to 12 weeks paid maternity, adoption and shared parental leave 
Subsidised onsite gym membership and weekly fitness classes 
Cycle to Work Scheme – enjoy a carbon free commute on us! 
Life assurance and personal accident insurance 
Other perks and Culture 
In addition to the listed benefits above, day-to-day life at Limejump is packed full of perks. There is flexibility to split your working week between home and office as well as flexible working hours to allow for balancing work with personal responsibility and circumstances. In the office we have ample comfortable breakout and booth spaces to promote a collaborative working environment. We have a pool table, regularly stocked snacks and drinks, casual working attire and the option to occasionally bring your best fur friend into work with you. 
On top of this we have regular company, department, and team socials to bond with colleagues outside of day-to-day work. Some examples of social and knowledge sharing events include our Summer and end of year party, Stress Awareness Month, Ramadan and World Pizza Day.

At Palantir, we're passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use their data. Our technology has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir's platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you'll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You'll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world's most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you'll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
Our Principles
 Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. 
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. 
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points. 
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use: 
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github 
Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them. 
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data. 
Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial but not necessary.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
 
 Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location. 
Requirements 
Security clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems. 
The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration. 
You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level. 
Technologies We Use 
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. 
TypeScript and React are central to our front-end development. 
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library. 
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand. 
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub. 
What We Value 
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work. 
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems. 
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building. 
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. 
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.

We love working here, and have even taken the number one spot in the Sunday Times Best Company To Work For 2015 and 16 lists; we’ve stopped entering now to focus on a few bigger projects, but you get the idea. It’s a great place to work. 
 
There are currently over 500,000 active Simply Business insurance policies in the UK alone. And we have offices in London, Northampton and Boston, USA. Talking of offices, ours are bright, airy and geared up for really smart working. We’re flexible, with plenty of remote workers coming in and out, and we believe work and life should be hand in hand, rather than a juggling act. So no need to worry about school pick-ups, or a horrible commute. 
Our people are our most important asset, so we focus on building a working life that helps us thrive, not stick. We're proud of our inclusive and supportive culture, and we're passionate about creating an environment where everyone's cultural backgrounds, skills, and perspectives are valued. Join us and you’ll be part of our journey to creating something even better, for our customers and ourselves.
 
 As a Software Engineer you’ll: 
Develop customer-focused products in a culture that champions Agile, cross functional teams and continuous collaboration
 
 Responsibilities include: 
Being hands-on in developing our products using best practices, appropriate tools and technologies 
Working with cross functional collaborative teams, helping to clarify requirements at the onset of projects and suggesting different and relevant technical approaches 
Championing Agile processes whilst creating amazingly useful systems in a collaborative way for our customers 
Highlighting areas for continuous improvement and driving their prioritisation 
Being proactive in suggesting new tools, technologies and ways of working
 
 What we’re looking for: 
Strong programming skills in any language. We look for strong Engineers and our philosophy is that a strong Engineer is not defined by the technologies they use; therefore Ruby experience is not essential. You’ll just need to be happy to cross-over to Ruby if you join us – and we will support you with that 
The ability to communicate complex technical concepts to both tech and non-tech colleagues 
Understanding and appreciation of Agile methodologies 
Strong desire to work collaboratively with business teams. We do not divide ‘business’ and tech’ teams, we see both as one team as we are all working towards one shared goal 
Strong interpersonal skills to work well in our very open and friendly environment 
Pro-active in suggesting new tools, processes and technologies – anything which will help us continually improve!

Limejump is a technology platform that manages a large renewable energy network. Our portfolio delivers clean energy to businesses and homes, using renewables and stored energy when it’s needed to meet demand. 
We connect and manage 100% renewable energy through the intelligent control of renewable generators, such as wind turbines and solar panels. We work closely with renewable asset owners, buying their energy and then selling it onto the UK’s grid, giving them simple access to the power market. But, the sun isn’t always shining and the wind isn’t always blowing. We must therefore capture energy for times when there is high demand. By harnessing big data and renewable technology, we accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.
 About the role: 
As a member of the scheduling team, you would be working at the heart of the Limejump platform. The team’s focus is to aid Limejump’s scaling ambitions by automating the translation of traded market positions into instructions for assets such as batteries. 
You will be joining an enthusiastic team of 3 people who enjoy what they do. Alongside delivering clean, well tested, understandable code you would be spending time getting into the finer details of the energy industry domain. The team regularly spends time together understanding the ins and outs of National Grid services systems that balance energy supply and demand. 
This team regularly must solve problems that are unsolved elsewhere. The changes required to decarbonise the UK power grid are immense, and we need a lot of intelligent software to do this. One example of these unsolved problems is getting hundreds of individual batteries to behave with the same stability as a large coal fired power plant. 
The team has a commitment to continuous improvement. They hold regular retrospectives, participate in blameless postmortems and hold a regular developer session where they address how they are advancing towards the goal of quality working software. 
 
You will: 
Work closely with the product owner to understand requirements 
Understand end-user needs and develop software solutions 
Continuously improve existing solutions for greater performance and flexibility 
Deliver quality software by ensuring testing is in place 
Collaborate with other developers to design systems and write code
 
 Essential requirements: 
Desire and willingness to learn about the energy industry domain in detail 
A passion for Limejump's vision of a sustainable future, and a commitment to our values 
Experience with Python 
Open and collaborative attitude with a desire to help others 
Happy to build software in an agile way
 
 Desirable skills and experience: 
Postgres or some experience with relational databases 
Understanding of container-based architecture – e.g. Docker and container orchestrators such as Kubernetes 
Go or willingness to learn Go 
Django 
Worked with CI/CD practises 
Interest or willingness to learn TDD 
Experience within the energy industry 
£1k annual innovation budget to spend on self development coupled with 10% time off work to do it 
Private Medical Insurance with AXA PPP with £0 annual excess 
25 days annual leave…and one extra day for your birthday 
Flexible working options to suit your personal life (including caring responsibility and/or your cultural background)

Parental leave – up to 12 weeks paid maternity, adoption and shared parental leave 
Subsidised onsite gym membership and weekly fitness classes 
Cycle to Work Scheme – enjoy a carbon free commute on us! 
Life assurance and personal accident insurance 
Other perks and Culture 
In addition to the listed benefits above, day-to-day life at Limejump is packed full of perks. There is flexibility to split your working week between home and office as well as flexible working hours to allow for balancing work with personal responsibility and circumstances. In the office we have ample comfortable breakout and booth spaces to promote a collaborative working environment. We have a pool table, regularly stocked snacks and drinks, casual working attire and the option to occasionally bring your best fur friend into work with you. 
On top of this we have regular company, department, and team socials to bond with colleagues outside of day-to-day work. Some examples of social and knowledge sharing events include our Summer and end of year party, Stress Awareness Month, Ramadan and World Pizza Day.

 Short Term: 
We need to build out our data engineering processes and develop internal APIs to connect the data we have (billions of rows from retailers in Snowflake, assorted semi-structured data that needs to go into ElasticSearch) with the productions that we’re shipping. 
 
Longer-Term: 
Grow with us and ship amazing data products doing it. There’s a clear path and opportunities to grow from wherever you are now to senior-lead engineer and a whole range of software challenges, not limited to: 
Aggregated product search (various sources into ElasticSearch, scored based on context) 
ML & heuristics for inferring product data & attributes 
Loads of data engineering to bring onboard new clients (big FMCG Retailers and Brands) 
A definition of a more comprehensive ETL process (introduce Airflow / Prefect / similar) 
Developing analytical reporting and tools to bring sophisticated analysis (let’s start with regression, but there’s some great stuff to be done)
 
 Work with Great Tools: 
Python 
SQL 
Typescript 
Postgres 
Jupyter Notebooks (Colab) 
Snowflake 
Redis 
GraphQL (Typescript / Apollo) 
Docker 
Pulumi 
Kubernetes 
CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
 
 Work with Great People: 
We’re a small, high-performance team who care about what we’re working on and each other. Your commercial colleagues will be ready and excited to put the products we ship in front of huge international clients such as Heinz, Mars and Tesco as well as relax and have some fun together to celebrate our achievements. 
 
Things We’ll Need From You: 
A desire and ability to build great software products 
An ability to perform in a semi/unstructured working environment 
To talk directly to the people using the software we build and empathise with their issues to prioritise our work 
An appreciation for the longer-term impact of the decisions being made now: the data engineering decisions being made now have to set us up for success in the years to come 
To be able to provide and receive clear and honest communication 
A broad sense of responsibility - it’s a startup: nothing is someone else’s job
 
 Other Relevant Information: 
A balance of WFH/Office, based on whatever you prefer 
There are no minimum years of experience nor few strict requirements other than you just being really good at shipping software, plus you’re not expected to know everything from day one 
We’d like you to start ASAP 
Our revenue grew 158% in 2021, which was a pretty crazy year 
We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to people of all backgrounds 
If you’re an agency, please don’t interpret this as an invitation to try and sell us your services. We’re not going to outsource our company’s core technology 
We need someone who has the right to work in the UK 
Autonomy and power over products that sit at the core of this startup. 
A flexible working environment - as long as the results are getting delivered, just figure out a schedule that works for you. 
A good salary, pencilled in at GBP 70-90k based on ability, can be traded off against equity depending on what you want. 
Share options with fair terms. 
An end of year performance-based bonus. 
As little bureaucracy as we can get away with (but no less). 
Standard benefits like pension etc. 
The best equipment we can buy you (an M-series MBP). 
The clearest and most transparent communication we can manage at all times. 
An experience: working at a startup should be exciting and this should be no exception. 
Opportunities to travel to meet clients nationally/internationally. 
A similar bonus structure as the sales team if you make an introduction to a big FMCG customer that turns into a sale. 
Something missing? Please let us know. 
Get in contact with your details here, email j.e@storetrials.com or find me on LinkedIn -linkedin.com/in/joshuaalexanderevans 
20-30 minute video call 
Technical algorithm question take home. 
45-minute technical review (either a take-home task we can provide or one you’ve done recently / have open sourced in order to save you the time and effort) 
60-minute technical algorithm interview over screen-share. 
One final conversation to answer any outstanding questions that you or we may have

 Engineering track 
Developing sophisticated software to better the world. The software engineer's role is to engineer the delivery of working software that meets our client's needs. 
Sounds fancy, right? As a Software Engineer at Entelect you are responsible for more than just writing code. You will find that the process, environment, tooling and even maturity of the client’s software knowledge varies across the teams, so the Software Engineer’s job would vary too, depending on the situation. Being adaptable as a Software Engineer is very important. You will find that as you transition through different projects, teams, domains and clients, you will always be learning - and that’s part of what makes working at Entelect cool. 
 
About the role 
If you are at this point in your career, it means that you have experience, you are working fairly independently and are probably becoming everyone's ‘go-to guy’. As an Intermediate you are expected to be skilled enough that you can assist other Software Engineers. You have a good sense of things like coding principles, stakeholder engagement and you are a damn good trouble-shooter because you understand how systems fit together, and when and who to ask for help. At this point in your career, you should also be able to architect basic components of a system. 
 
Our UK business is just getting started, so you'll have an opportunity to shape our identity as we grow. We have big ambitions and the support from our hugely successful South African business. 
Our UK package includes: 
Hybrid work arrangement 
Pension scheme with company contribution 
Life assurance and income protection 
Generous leave allowance 
Furthermore, you get to experience Entelect culture and all it has to offer: 
Professional and personal growth 
Training, mentorship and exposure to lots of different opportunities to experiment and learn. 
 
Project variety 
With a variety of projects using an array of technologies across various business domains, you can find work that suits you. 
 
Team-based projects 
All our projects are team-based, so you're always with other experienced people who will show you best practices and involve you in finding new and innovative ways to do things. 
 
Work with like-minded people 
Fellowship is forged with people who care about you, their craft and the hobbies you share. 
 
Tech company run by tech people 
We’re an ambitious, growing organisation without the usual nonsense and politics. 
 
Autonomy and identity 
We function as a tribe of tribes, so there’s plenty of autonomy and scope to create a different identity for each project and team.

We’ve grown into 3 continents and we’re always looking for awesome devs, analysts, UX gurus, data engineers and scientists, architects, leaders, and more.

 Short Term: 
We need to build out our data engineering processes and develop internal APIs to connect the data we have (billions of rows from retailers in Snowflake, assorted semi-structured data that needs to go into ElasticSearch) with the productions that we’re shipping. 
 
Longer-Term: 
Grow with us and ship amazing data products doing it. There’s a clear path and opportunities to grow from wherever you are now to senior-lead engineer and a whole range of software challenges, not limited to: 
Aggregated product search (various sources into ElasticSearch, scored based on context) 
ML & heuristics for inferring product data & attributes 
Loads of data engineering to bring onboard new clients (big FMCG Retailers and Brands) 
A definition of a more comprehensive ETL process (introduce Airflow / Prefect / similar) 
Developing analytical reporting and tools to bring sophisticated analysis (let’s start with regression, but there’s some great stuff to be done)
 
 Work with Great Tools: 
Python 
SQL 
Typescript 
Postgres 
Jupyter Notebooks (Colab) 
Snowflake 
Redis 
GraphQL (Typescript / Apollo) 
Docker 
Pulumi 
Kubernetes 
CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
 
 Work with Great People: 
We’re a small, high-performance team who care about what we’re working on and each other. Your commercial colleagues will be ready and excited to put the products we ship in front of huge international clients such as Heinz, Mars and Tesco as well as relax and have some fun together to celebrate our achievements. 
 
Things We’ll Need From You: 
A desire and ability to build great software products 
An ability to perform in a semi/unstructured working environment 
To talk directly to the people using the software we build and empathise with their issues to prioritise our work 
An appreciation for the longer-term impact of the decisions being made now: the data engineering decisions being made now have to set us up for success in the years to come 
To be able to provide and receive clear and honest communication 
A broad sense of responsibility - it’s a startup: nothing is someone else’s job
 
 Other Relevant Information: 
A balance of WFH/Office, based on whatever you prefer 
There are no minimum years of experience nor few strict requirements other than you just being really good at shipping software, plus you’re not expected to know everything from day one 
We’d like you to start ASAP 
Our revenue grew 158% in 2021, which was a pretty crazy year 
We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to people of all backgrounds 
If you’re an agency, please don’t interpret this as an invitation to try and sell us your services. We’re not going to outsource our company’s core technology 
We need someone who has the right to work in the UK 
Autonomy and power over products that sit at the core of this startup. 
A flexible working environment - as long as the results are getting delivered, just figure out a schedule that works for you. 
A good salary, pencilled in at GBP 70-90k based on ability, can be traded off against equity depending on what you want. 
Share options with fair terms. 
An end of year performance-based bonus. 
As little bureaucracy as we can get away with (but no less). 
Standard benefits like pension etc. 
The best equipment we can buy you (an M-series MBP). 
The clearest and most transparent communication we can manage at all times. 
An experience: working at a startup should be exciting and this should be no exception. 
Opportunities to travel to meet clients nationally/internationally. 
A similar bonus structure as the sales team if you make an introduction to a big FMCG customer that turns into a sale. 
Something missing? Please let us know. 
Get in contact with your details here, email j.e@storetrials.com or find me on LinkedIn -linkedin.com/in/joshuaalexanderevans 
20-30 minute video call 
Technical algorithm question take home. 
45-minute technical review (either a take-home task we can provide or one you’ve done recently / have open sourced in order to save you the time and effort) 
60-minute technical algorithm interview over screen-share. 
One final conversation to answer any outstanding questions that you or we may have 
Job offer 
We can move quickly if necessary - if we do 4&5 back to back we've completed the entire process in under a week previously.

The final stage will be an interview with DWP Digital to assess behaviours and skills.

Please speak to your recruiter about the working pattern that works best for you. 
Location: UK - London, with ability to work remote

We work closely with our clients and each other, at every stage of every project, solving our clients’ trickiest problems with a mix of knowledge, creativity and intellectual rigour. A hugely diverse range of clients rely on us to deliver the kind of change that adds genuine, lasting value to their business. 
Personal independence 
Regulation and controls are standard practice in our industry and Deloitte is no exception. These controls provide important legal protection for both you and the firm. We are subject to a number of audit regulations, one of which requires that certain colleagues abide by specific personal independence constraints. This can mean that you and your ""Immediate Family Members"" are not permitted to hold certain financial interests (shares, funds, bonds etc.) with audit clients of the firm. The recruitment team will provide further detail as you progress through the recruitment process. 
About Deloitte 
Our Purpose & Strategy 
To make an impact that matters for our clients, our people and society - defines who we are and what we stand for. Our purpose provides the foundation for our strategy and our aspiration to be the undisputed leader in professional services: this is not about size, it's about being the first choice. The first choice for the largest and most influential clients, and the first choice for the best talent.
 What do we do? 
Deloitte offers global integrated professional services that include Audit & Assurance, Consulting, Financial Advisory, Legal, Risk Advisory and Tax Consulting. Our approach combines intellectual leadership, industrial expertise, insight, consulting & problem solving capabilities whatever the role, technology revolutions and innovation from multiple disciplines to help our clients excel anywhere in the world. 
Beyond the UK: Deloitte North and South Europe 
The UK is part of Deloitte North and South Europe (NSE), the second largest member firm in the Deloitte network. Deloitte NSE combines operations in Belgium, Central Mediterranean (Italy, Greece, Malta), Ireland, the Middle East (Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Palestinian Ruled Territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen), the Netherlands, the Nordics (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), Switzerland and the UK.

Being part of Deloitte NSE supports our aspiration to be the undisputed leader in professional services and will create more opportunity and growth for our people. 
What do we value? 
What brings us all together at Deloitte? It’s how we approach the thousands of decisions we make every day. How we behave, our beliefs and our attitudes. In other words: our values. Whatever we do, wherever we are in the world, we lead the way, serve with integrity, take care of each other, foster inclusion, and collaborate for maximum impact. These five shared values lead every decision we make and action we take, guiding us to deliver impact how and where it matters most.
 Being a Leader at Deloitte 
Cultural fit and purpose-led leadership is crucial for Deloitte. Our leaders always set the example and inspire their colleagues. They make quality time for people and take an interest in them. They know what matters to people - both inside and outside work – and value them as individuals; always finding opportunities to develop them while showing respect and appreciation. 
We expect colleagues at all levels to embrace and live our purpose and our leadership culture by challenging themselves to identify issues that are most important for our clients, our people, and for society and make an impact that matters. We know leadership comes in all shapes and sizes, but our Leadership Charter helps all of our people understand what we’re looking for: 
We live our purpose:  we act as a role model, embracing and living our purpose and values, and recognizing others for the impact they make 
We develop talent:  we develop high-performing people and teams through challenging and meaningful opportunities 
We drive performance:  we deliver exceptional client service; maximize results and drive high performance from people while fostering collaboration across businesses and borders 
We believe positive influence can make an impact that matters:  we influence clients, teams, and individuals positively, leading by example and establishing confident relationships with increasingly senior people 
We move, together, towards a strategic direction:  we understand key objectives for clients and Deloitte, aligning people to objectives and setting priorities and direction.

You’ll need to be comfortable understanding their needs and discussing potentially complex technical ideas with all of them 
 A positive, can-do team player:  You love pushing the team to greater heights by helping colleagues out wherever you can. You always look to improve yourself and others. Your default answer to a question is ‘yes’, and you make big problems seem small

We recommend applying for your internship in the first term of the academic year, autumn 2021. 
 More about Softwire: What you’ll be part of 
 
Our mission is to solve our customers’ business challenges using technology. This often demands creativity, tackling complex issues in intelligent ways, to help organisations streamline operations and ultimately better serve their customers and users. 
 
We played an important role in the Moorfields Eye Hospital/DeepMind collaboration, which demonstrated how artificial intelligence could help doctors fast-track patients with serious eye diseases. We built the system that runs the BBC Live Events websites, sharing content from Glastonbury, the Reading and Leeds festivals, and the BBC Proms. We’ve been the long-term digital partner for David Lloyd Leisure, building its mobile app, booking system and numerous other capabilities. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Find out what else we’ve been involved with. 
 
Of course, there’s more to Softwire than building software. We’re working hard to nurture a diverse, inclusive and supportive culture, where people love what they do and feel inspired by working with some of the best minds in the business. We also have a generous budget for a varied programme of staff events and activities, with employees, not management, deciding how the money is spent. 
 
Put all of this together, and you see why we’ve got such high retention rates, and why we’ve been in the Best Companies to Work For list, 10 years in a row.

Our application includes: Patient medical record system Comprehensive consultation suite Document management Scheduling Accounting Email Social network Task management Referral management Reporting and query system for analytics Clinical text analysis using NLP Collaboration system Practice networking Patient portal Occupational health portal PACS system (MRI/X-ray/Ultrasound) And much more… We have a very relaxed working environment that is more akin to a start-up than a company that’s been running since 2004. We have a team of 20 + developers who are very capable and committed which work in our very collaborative environment. Obviously with web-application development there’s a reasonable amount of CRUD work, that’s a given. But we have also developed interesting in-house tech of our own (distributed databases for document storage, natural language processing for clinical text parsing, UI frameworks, DSLs, language-ext, and echo-process, to name a few). We run on our own machines in high-security data-centres as well as hosting some systems in Azure. We have Infrastructure and Site Reliability Engineers that work closely with the Developers on deployments and monitoring. The people we need are ‘self starters’ and are happy to work on any part of the stack, from UI, to back-end, to data-centre automation, services etc. You must be prepared to develop code using the functional paradigm – this is super important! We need creatively minded individuals who can solve unique problems; not just with code problems, but in improving healthcare too. We need programmers than can hear a real world problem and think creatively and with empathy for the end user. You should have significant C# and web-development experience. Haskell and F# experience is useful but not essential. We have a number of micro-services and libraries written in F# and will be implementing some of our new key architecture in Haskell. If you don’t have functional language experience, you will be expected to learn and use it (the core application is C#, so that will give you time to get up to speed anyway). We encourage Developers to share their knowledge with the rest of the team and run book clubs and presentations to facilitate this. We value career progression for individual contributors and have a number of Developers that now hold Principal Software Engineer positions, you don’t have to become a manager to be promoted here. If you know Language-Ext (and understand why it exists) then that will help, as we use it throughout the ecosystem to bring robustness. SQL Server is our primary database solution, so experience with that is essential – but we also use Postgres. If you have any Postgres experience that would be valuable. Ideally you will be degree educated, but what we do want to see is experience and a passion for what you do. Github projects are incredibly helpful for that, but any examples of work are also valuable. Written and spoken English must be good and you must be a UK resident and have the right to work in the UK. Skills & requirements:  Significant experience in C# and evidence of a varied career in software development. Desirable:  Haskell or F# experience (or any functional language). A willingness to use the functional language paradigm rather than OO. SQL Server / any relational database experience. Web application development experience. Company benefits:  We offer competitive salaries for all of our roles and have an employee profit share scheme. Our working environment is friendly and comfortable. Our working hours are 9am - 5.30 pm with an hour for lunch. You will not be expected to work extremely long hours, as so often happens in software companies. We prefer the approach of 'it's a marathon not a sprint', so we actively discourage working grueling hours. Ad-hoc home working is also a part of our working culture as we understand the need for flexibility. Here are our benefits that you can enjoy: Life Assurance (4X salary). Subsidised gym membership. Private healthcare (length of service conditions apply). Adhoc and scheduled social events. Beverages plus fruit and biscuits available for peckish moments in the office! Quarterly town hall meetings with drinks and snacks. Opportunities to get involved with our 'culture committee'. Optional participation in charity events. Medical Management Systems is an equal opportunities employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability status.

Are you looking for a career in tech that truly helps make the world a better place? Bp is moving through the biggest transition in its 100+ year history with the goal of becoming one of the world’s largest renewable energy providers and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. To make this transition, we are hiring staff and principal software engineers to power our business end to end, from building new infrastructure and services through to customer facing web and native mobile applications. We build exclusively on the cloud using Azure and AWS, so we can adapt quickly, demonstrate the latest technology, and scale our business globally. We want to be in touch with builders that are comfortable defining their own direction, who can move fast and tackle complex challenges, and who want to work with strong peers and leaders from tech companies like Uber, Google, Facebook, Tesla, and Amazon. 
Background 
Bp's Innovation & Engineering (I&E) organization is the central organization for all software development. We build all the technology that powers BP’s businesses, from upstream energy production to downstream delivery of energy to our customers. We have a variety of teams depending on your areas of interest, including infrastructure and backend services through to customer-facing web and native applications. We encourage our teams to adapt quickly by using native AWS and Azure services, including serverless, and enable them to pick the best technology for a given problem. This is meant to empower our software engineers while allowing them to learn and develop themselves. 
What you will do for us... 
Design sophisticated software components, services, and applications. You’ll write design documents and review them with your software engineering and architecture peers, incorporating and quickly iterating on the feedback. 
Lead multiple squads or organizations of engineers in delivery of your projects to production. You’ll follow best practices including writing high quality code, developing unit, functional, and performance tests, and creating end-to-end deployment pipelines to production to maintain a fast velocity. 
Integrate your software with other distributed systems and shared APIs across bp. You’ll work closely with partner teams to help evolve their systems to make all our services more re-usable and resilient. 
Hire and develop others by mentoring junior software engineers and peers, and proactively sharing your expertise and interests with others. 
Partner closely with multi-functional teams including product management, data science, and UX design. 
Qualifications 
At least ten years of experience designing and building complex software systems end-to-end which have been efficiently delivered to production. You’ll have supported these production systems through on-call rotations. 
Expertise in at least one language (C/C++, Java, C#, Python) including object-oriented design. You should be proficient in data structures, algorithms, runtime complexity, API, and database design, as well as unit and functional test methodologies. 
Experience in system design of both new and existing systems. You should understand security and privacy best practices as well as how to properly monitor, log, and alarm for production systems. 
Strong communication skills and ability to communicate with your peers through to senior leaders. To be successful you need to be able to engage and influence others to collect requirements, describe what you’re doing, and work through problems and find productive solutions. 
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

 Short Term: 
We need to build out our data engineering processes and develop internal APIs to connect the data we have (billions of rows from retailers in Snowflake, assorted semi-structured data that needs to go into ElasticSearch) with the productions that we’re shipping. 
 
Longer-Term: 
Grow with us and ship amazing data products doing it. There’s a clear path and opportunities to grow from wherever you are now to senior-lead engineer and a whole range of software challenges, not limited to: 
Aggregated product search (various sources into ElasticSearch, scored based on context) 
ML & heuristics for inferring product data & attributes 
Loads of data engineering to bring onboard new clients (big FMCG Retailers and Brands) 
A definition of a more comprehensive ETL process (introduce Airflow / Prefect / similar) 
Developing analytical reporting and tools to bring sophisticated analysis (let’s start with regression, but there’s some great stuff to be done)
 
 Work with Great Tools: 
Python 
SQL 
Typescript 
Postgres 
Jupyter Notebooks (Colab) 
Snowflake 
Redis 
GraphQL (Typescript / Apollo) 
Docker 
Pulumi 
Kubernetes 
CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
 
 Work with Great People: 
We’re a small, high-performance team who care about what we’re working on and each other. Your commercial colleagues will be ready and excited to put the products we ship in front of huge international clients such as Heinz, Mars and Tesco as well as relax and have some fun together to celebrate our achievements. 
 
Things We’ll Need From You: 
A desire and ability to build great software products 
An ability to perform in a semi/unstructured working environment 
To talk directly to the people using the software we build and empathise with their issues to prioritise our work 
An appreciation for the longer-term impact of the decisions being made now: the data engineering decisions being made now have to set us up for success in the years to come 
To be able to provide and receive clear and honest communication 
A broad sense of responsibility - it’s a startup: nothing is someone else’s job
 
 Other Relevant Information: 
A balance of WFH/Office, based on whatever you prefer 
There are no minimum years of experience nor few strict requirements other than you just being really good at shipping software, plus you’re not expected to know everything from day one 
We’d like you to start ASAP 
Our revenue grew 158% in 2021, which was a pretty crazy year 
We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to people of all backgrounds 
If you’re an agency, please don’t interpret this as an invitation to try and sell us your services. We’re not going to outsource our company’s core technology 
We need someone who has the right to work in the UK 
Autonomy and power over products that sit at the core of this startup. 
A flexible working environment - as long as the results are getting delivered, just figure out a schedule that works for you. 
A good salary, pencilled in at GBP 70-90k based on ability, can be traded off against equity depending on what you want. 
Share options with fair terms. 
An end of year performance-based bonus. 
As little bureaucracy as we can get away with (but no less). 
Standard benefits like pension etc. 
The best equipment we can buy you (an M-series MBP). 
The clearest and most transparent communication we can manage at all times. 
An experience: working at a startup should be exciting and this should be no exception. 
Opportunities to travel to meet clients nationally/internationally. 
A similar bonus structure as the sales team if you make an introduction to a big FMCG customer that turns into a sale. 
Something missing? Please let us know. 
Get in contact with your details here, email j.e@storetrials.com or find me on LinkedIn -linkedin.com/in/joshuaalexanderevans 
20-30 minute video call 
Technical algorithm question take home. 
45-minute technical review (either a take-home task we can provide or one you’ve done recently / have open sourced in order to save you the time and effort) 
60-minute technical algorithm interview over screen-share. 
One final conversation to answer any outstanding questions that you or we may have 
Job offer 
We can move quickly if necessary - if we do 4&5 back to back we've completed the entire process in under a week previously.

High performance robotic solutions are no longer limited to factories and warehouses, but are becoming more and more common in environments such as hospitals, hotels and homes. Autonomous cars are starting to emerge out of the lab and AR/VR headsets are allowing us to overlay the digital world on the real world. As these machines operate in less constrained, more dynamic environments, spatial understanding is essential for reliable operation and intelligent behaviour.
 There are three levels of spatial understanding required: localisation (position), mapping (map) and semantics (perceive). Using vision as the core sensing modality, all three levels of spatial understanding can be combined to offer full stack spatial Intelligence, providing richer maps, robustness to change and greater adaptability to challenging, dynamic environments. 
SLAMcore is a London-based, globally focused startup founded by visual SLAM algorithm pioneers and specialists. Having raised over $20M of VC funding from top investors around the world, we are developing breakthrough spatial intelligence solutions for next generation robots and autonomous machines by harnessing computer vision, sensor fusion and machine learning.
 Our aim is to greatly reduce the time and cost for companies to deploy advanced robotic solutions whilst delivering performance they could never achieve on their own. Our customers include some of the biggest tech companies on the planet building solutions from vacuum cleaning to warehouse and logistics.

About Cleo 
Most people come to Cleo to do work that matters. Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions. 
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in. 
We’re looking for a brilliant Frontend React/React Native Engineer with an eye for UI/UX design to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them. 
 
What you’ll be doing 
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of frontend engineers, designers, UX writers, backend engineers, data analysts and others to develop features that improve our users’ financial health 
Working on our React Native application, building out amazing experiences for our users which bring financial health to life in the unique Cleo tone of voice. 
Writing automated tests alongside your code to give us the confidence to ship it 
Using AB-Tests, feature flags and other tools that let us iterate quickly 
Using data to dig into user journeys, detecting problems and helping to optimise the Cleo experience 
Being part of the rota for our weekly app releases to the Apple and Google app stores 
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the frontend chapter 
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews. 
Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year: 
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits. 
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget. 
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users. 
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will be shipping changes multiple times a week to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need. 
 
About you 
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide. 
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value. 
For this frontend focused role, we also have some specific asks: 
As this is a SE2-SE3 position we’re looking for someone with strong industry experience of using React and/or React Native with TypeScript for a minimum of 2 years. If it’s a lot more than that, maybe you want to look at our Senior role. 
As your work will primarily involve working on features for our mobile apps, we’d either like to see some proven experience in this area or a genuine passion for moving into the mobile app space.
 
 What do you get for all your hard work? 
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews . You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/ - This position is a SE2-SE3 level and we can pay £49,420 - £79,396 p.a. depending on experience. 
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures 
A clear progression plan.  We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support. 
Flexibility : We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work 
Work where you work best.  We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.

 Workplace & Diversity 
 
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation. 
 
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space."

Our application includes: Patient medical record system Comprehensive consultation suite Document management Scheduling Accounting Email Social network Task management Referral management Reporting and query system for analytics Clinical text analysis using NLP Collaboration system Practice networking Patient portal Occupational health portal PACS system (MRI/X-ray/Ultrasound) And much more… We have a very relaxed working environment that is more akin to a start-up than a company that’s been running since 2004. We have a team of 20 + developers who are very capable and committed which work in our very collaborative environment. Obviously with web-application development there’s a reasonable amount of CRUD work, that’s a given. But we have also developed interesting in-house tech of our own (distributed databases for document storage, natural language processing for clinical text parsing, UI frameworks, DSLs, language-ext, and echo-process, to name a few). We run on our own machines in high-security data-centres as well as hosting some systems in Azure. We have Infrastructure and Site Reliability Engineers that work closely with the Developers on deployments and monitoring. The people we need are ‘self starters’ and are happy to work on any part of the stack, from UI, to back-end, to data-centre automation, services etc. You must be prepared to develop code using the functional paradigm – this is super important! We need creatively minded individuals who can solve unique problems; not just with code problems, but in improving healthcare too. We need programmers than can hear a real world problem and think creatively and with empathy for the end user. You should have significant C# and web-development experience. Haskell and F# experience is useful but not essential. We have a number of micro-services and libraries written in F# and will be implementing some of our new key architecture in Haskell. If you don’t have functional language experience, you will be expected to learn and use it (the core application is C#, so that will give you time to get up to speed anyway). We encourage Developers to share their knowledge with the rest of the team and run book clubs and presentations to facilitate this. We value career progression for individual contributors and have a number of Developers that now hold Principal Software Engineer positions, you don’t have to become a manager to be promoted here. If you know Language-Ext (and understand why it exists) then that will help, as we use it throughout the ecosystem to bring robustness. SQL Server is our primary database solution, so experience with that is essential – but we also use Postgres. If you have any Postgres experience that would be valuable. Ideally you will be degree educated, but what we do want to see is experience and a passion for what you do. Github projects are incredibly helpful for that, but any examples of work are also valuable. Written and spoken English must be good and you must be a UK resident and have the right to work in the UK. Skills & requirements:  Significant experience in C# and evidence of a varied career in software development. Desirable:  Haskell or F# experience (or any functional language). A willingness to use the functional language paradigm rather than OO. SQL Server / any relational database experience. Web application development experience. Company benefits:  We offer competitive salaries for all of our roles and have an employee profit share scheme. Our working environment is friendly and comfortable. Our working hours are 9am - 5.30 pm with an hour for lunch. You will not be expected to work extremely long hours, as so often happens in software companies. We prefer the approach of 'it's a marathon not a sprint', so we actively discourage working grueling hours. Ad-hoc home working is also a part of our working culture as we understand the need for flexibility. Here are our benefits that you can enjoy: Life Assurance (4X salary). Subsidised gym membership. Private healthcare (length of service conditions apply). Adhoc and scheduled social events. Beverages plus fruit and biscuits available for peckish moments in the office! Quarterly town hall meetings with drinks and snacks. Opportunities to get involved with our 'culture committee'. Optional participation in charity events. Medical Management Systems is an equal opportunities employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability status.

 About the job 
At Google, we follow a simple but vital premise: ""Focus on the user and all else will follow."" User Experience Researchers (UXRs) make this possible.
 
 
Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the needs, attitudes, emotions, and behaviors of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses. 
 
As a User Experience Researcher (UXR), you’ll help your team of UXers, product managers, and engineers understand user needs. You’ll work with stakeholders across functions and levels and have impact at all stages of product development. You’ll play a critical role in creating useful, usable, and delightful products. You’ll explore user behaviors and motivations by conducting primary research such as field studies, interviews, diary studies, participatory workshops, ethnography, surveys, usability testing, and logs analysis.
 
 
The UXR community at Google is unique and will help you do your best work. You’ll have the opportunity to work with and learn from UXRs across Google through regular meetups, mentor programs, and access to internal research tools. 
User experience is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users’ needs, behaviors, and emotions to gather insights that inform product strategy and design. Our UX teams include designers, researchers, content strategists, and engineers who are passionate about quality, usability, and simplicity. We work on collaborative teams to solve complex challenges and craft experiences that highlight our products’ unique capabilities and personalities. Our work touches billions while exemplifying a key principle that is core to Google’s philosophy: “Focus on the user and all else will follow.” 
Responsibilities 
 Conduct independent research by collecting and analyzing user behavior through a range of mixed methods (e.g., lab studies, field visits, interviews, ethnography, surveys, concept evaluations, etc.). 
 Conduct foundational, strategic, and iterative research. Work with stakeholders to formulate research questions and collaborate to draw out insights. 
 Partner closely with cross-functional stakeholders to understand research needs, and craft and execute studies that address priorities in a fast-paced, rapidly changing environment. 
 Drive change by communicating compelling and actionable findings to diverse audiences. Impact product strategy and design through your research. 
 Deliver business impact by advocating for the user in key business decisions. 
 Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

Are you looking for a career in tech that truly helps make the world a better place? Bp is moving through the biggest transition in its 100+ year history with the goal of becoming one of the world’s largest renewable energy providers and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. To make this transition, we are hiring staff and principal software engineers to power our business end to end, from building new infrastructure and services through to customer facing web and native mobile applications. We build exclusively on the cloud using Azure and AWS, so we can adapt quickly, demonstrate the latest technology, and scale our business globally. We want to be in touch with builders that are comfortable defining their own direction, who can move fast and tackle complex challenges, and who want to work with strong peers and leaders from tech companies like Uber, Google, Facebook, Tesla, and Amazon. 
Background 
Bp's Innovation & Engineering (I&E) organization is the central organization for all software development. We build all the technology that powers BP’s businesses, from upstream energy production to downstream delivery of energy to our customers. We have a variety of teams depending on your areas of interest, including infrastructure and backend services through to customer-facing web and native applications. We encourage our teams to adapt quickly by using native AWS and Azure services, including serverless, and enable them to pick the best technology for a given problem. This is meant to empower our software engineers while allowing them to learn and develop themselves. 
What you will do for us... 
Design sophisticated software components, services, and applications. You’ll write design documents and review them with your software engineering and architecture peers, incorporating and quickly iterating on the feedback. 
Lead multiple squads or organizations of engineers in delivery of your projects to production. You’ll follow best practices including writing high quality code, developing unit, functional, and performance tests, and creating end-to-end deployment pipelines to production to maintain a fast velocity. 
Integrate your software with other distributed systems and shared APIs across bp. You’ll work closely with partner teams to help evolve their systems to make all our services more re-usable and resilient. 
Hire and develop others by mentoring junior software engineers and peers, and proactively sharing your expertise and interests with others. 
Partner closely with multi-functional teams including product management, data science, and UX design. 
Qualifications 
At least ten years of experience designing and building complex software systems end-to-end which have been efficiently delivered to production. You’ll have supported these production systems through on-call rotations. 
Expertise in at least one language (C/C++, Java, C#, Python) including object-oriented design. You should be proficient in data structures, algorithms, runtime complexity, API, and database design, as well as unit and functional test methodologies. 
Experience in system design of both new and existing systems. You should understand security and privacy best practices as well as how to properly monitor, log, and alarm for production systems. 
Strong communication skills and ability to communicate with your peers through to senior leaders. To be successful you need to be able to engage and influence others to collect requirements, describe what you’re doing, and work through problems and find productive solutions. 
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

We are in the business of selling peace of mind and want people to know that Napo is a synonym for quality. The pet insurance space has suffered from low quality and misleading products, and we want to ensure that all the Napo products are simple and have your back. 
We’ve created a digital-first approach: no letters, no phone calls, no back and forth via email. We want our customers to be able to do whatever they need from our website and app in minutes, whenever it works for them. And if they need some support, they can talk to us over the phone. 
The final piece in the puzzle is providing everything people need to take great care of their pets. Whether these are services such as behaviourist consultants, tools such as puppy training apps, or simply content, we aim to give pet owners everything they need to ensure their pet is happy and healthy for as long as possible. 
 
The Role 
Joining our Web Engineering team, you’ll directly work on features that better our members’ experiences of engaging with their pet insurance as well as improving the experiences for Napo’s customer support team through great internal tooling. 
Our stack is brand new, written in TypeScript, built with Next.js and React, and is continuously deployed via Vercel with end-to-end testing. We leverage packages where necessary and have defined our own shared component library which we end-to-end test. 
You’ll work in one of our 4 product teams alongside the best talent to work on projects such as: 
Improving pets’ health and wellbeing through preventative measures 
Building an amazing claims experience for difficult moments for pets and their owners 
Supporting the wider business in areas for growth opportunities
 
 Skills we think you need: 
Strong web fundamentals - you understand HTML, CSS, JavaScript proficiently. 
You have the ability to build end-to-end customer centric web experiences. 
You know how to stay on top of the latest trends and can test new practises and approaches quickly.
 
 Experience that is important to us: 
You’ll have worked with React or another popular framework in the past and understand modern framework concepts. 
You’re familiar with the notion of deploying quickly and often, testing in production and rolling features out gradually - using modern deployment pipelines to do so. 
You work well in a team, as well as independently, and have a willingness to learn and grow.
 
 Behaviours (outside our values ) to be successful in the role: 
You excel at taking ownership of projects, small or large, working in multidisciplinary teams on impactful work. 
You’re able to adapt and learn quickly. We’re still an early startup and as such we are still finding the best processes that suit us. Things might change!
 
Everyone is an owner at Napo; you will receive Growth Shares on day 1 
Flexible and remote-friendly work environment (for now, we would ideally love to have people in the office two days per week - we have a friendly office in central London) 
Flexible leave policy (28 days annual holidays + bank holidays), and we think you should get your birthday as a holiday.

We leverage our proprietary expertise in financial technology to identify, unlock and accelerate value for our portfolio companies and partners. We believe deeply in the power of technology to transform businesses and industries. Utilising our broad market connectivity and market leading technology capabilities we aim to be at the forefront of innovation as it emerges, delivering new capabilities into the hands of our portfolio and partners. 
Motive Create is structured across three centres of excellence: 
Services – Experts in executing due diligence, value creation planning and portfolio value creation execution 
Propositions – Drive innovation for our portfolio and partners 
Product – Build new technology assets and platforms that underpin our value creation and innovation activities 
We are currently recruiting Backend Software Engineers across two different Product teams:  Spoke  and  Sense . 
 
About the Product Teams: 
Spoke Marketplace  is forming the future of how marketplaces are used by the finance industry, and it requires passionate and creative product-centric engineers to support this effort. Our vision is to allow everyone and anyone to gain access to the products and services they need, through any channel. 
We believe that companies will move to having a marketplace business model, where they can offer both their own products and services as well as those of 3rd party providers so that their customers can get the things they need all in one place, in order to maintain customer intimacy. 
To support this transition, we have built a marketplace-as-a-service technology platform that allows anyone to create their own white label marketplace ecosystem, think of it as the ability to create your own Amazon, TaskRabbit and GoCompare all in one. 
Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for our customers to make, manage and scale their own personalised marketplace(s). And our strategy is to enable existing brands to do this, starting with a focus on financial institutions, particularly banks and the asset management industry. 
Sense  is a Personalised Digital Banking platform that enables partners to provide digital experiences that go beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to banking, instead meeting the needs of specific customer segments, connecting customers around their wants, needs and beliefs. It requires passionate and creative product-centric engineers to support this effort. 
With initiatives such as Open Banking, offering financial services is no longer restricted to just banks. We have built a platform that will also allow retail institutions to offer similar services to those previously restricted to banking partners, and by pulling retail data into our system, we can now combine data sets previously disparate to derive new insights and drive better outcomes for the end customer. 
We are unlocking an incredible opportunity to create truly personalised digital solutions for individuals and families – around the things that matter most to them – that go beyond what exists out in the market today. Every person is unique, every situation is individual, and every need is different. Our goal is to offer the platform to enable our clients to support this.

 Short Term: 
We need to build out our data engineering processes and develop internal APIs to connect the data we have (billions of rows from retailers in Snowflake, assorted semi-structured data that needs to go into ElasticSearch) with the productions that we’re shipping. 
 
Longer-Term: 
Grow with us and ship amazing data products doing it. There’s a clear path and opportunities to grow from wherever you are now to senior-lead engineer and a whole range of software challenges, not limited to: 
Aggregated product search (various sources into ElasticSearch, scored based on context) 
ML & heuristics for inferring product data & attributes 
Loads of data engineering to bring onboard new clients (big FMCG Retailers and Brands) 
A definition of a more comprehensive ETL process (introduce Airflow / Prefect / similar) 
Developing analytical reporting and tools to bring sophisticated analysis (let’s start with regression, but there’s some great stuff to be done)
 
 Work with Great Tools: 
Python 
SQL 
Typescript 
Postgres 
Jupyter Notebooks (Colab) 
Snowflake 
Redis 
GraphQL (Typescript / Apollo) 
Docker 
Pulumi 
Kubernetes 
CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
 
 Work with Great People: 
We’re a small, high-performance team who care about what we’re working on and each other. Your commercial colleagues will be ready and excited to put the products we ship in front of huge international clients such as Heinz, Mars and Tesco as well as relax and have some fun together to celebrate our achievements. 
 
Things We’ll Need From You: 
A desire and ability to build great software products 
An ability to perform in a semi/unstructured working environment 
To talk directly to the people using the software we build and empathise with their issues to prioritise our work 
An appreciation for the longer-term impact of the decisions being made now: the data engineering decisions being made now have to set us up for success in the years to come 
To be able to provide and receive clear and honest communication 
A broad sense of responsibility - it’s a startup: nothing is someone else’s job
 
 Other Relevant Information: 
A balance of WFH/Office, based on whatever you prefer 
There are no minimum years of experience nor few strict requirements other than you just being really good at shipping software, plus you’re not expected to know everything from day one 
We’d like you to start ASAP 
Our revenue grew 158% in 2021, which was a pretty crazy year 
We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to people of all backgrounds 
If you’re an agency, please don’t interpret this as an invitation to try and sell us your services. We’re not going to outsource our company’s core technology 
We need someone who has the right to work in the UK 
Autonomy and power over products that sit at the core of this startup. 
A flexible working environment - as long as the results are getting delivered, just figure out a schedule that works for you. 
A good salary, pencilled in at GBP 70-90k based on ability, can be traded off against equity depending on what you want. 
Share options with fair terms. 
An end of year performance-based bonus. 
As little bureaucracy as we can get away with (but no less). 
Standard benefits like pension etc. 
The best equipment we can buy you (an M-series MBP). 
The clearest and most transparent communication we can manage at all times. 
An experience: working at a startup should be exciting and this should be no exception. 
Opportunities to travel to meet clients nationally/internationally. 
A similar bonus structure as the sales team if you make an introduction to a big FMCG customer that turns into a sale. 
Something missing? Please let us know. 
Get in contact with your details here, email j.e@storetrials.com or find me on LinkedIn -linkedin.com/in/joshuaalexanderevans 
20-30 minute video call 
Technical algorithm question take home. 
45-minute technical review (either a take-home task we can provide or one you’ve done recently / have open sourced in order to save you the time and effort) 
60-minute technical algorithm interview over screen-share. 
One final conversation to answer any outstanding questions that you or we may have

It is ideal if you have a bit of an eye for design (which enables you to ship more quickly), although not essential. Our backend runs on Google Cloud Platform and is also written in Typescript. We like to work across the front end and back end on one feature, so that we personally feel the impact of our work on the customer. 
We are building a team of talented, motivated engineers who each take massive ownership of both the company and the problem space. 
Genuinely above-market equity.  We're not interested in small-scale outcomes and we know that you're not either. Engineers joining at this stage get best-in-market equity packages. 
In-person work.  We believe that in person work is better for the kind of fast-paced, creative problem solving that is involved in kickstarting something huge. We work 3-4 days a week in the office in King's Cross, London. 
Work on a product that customers actually love.  We can't get enough of the feeling when our customers tell us we helped them win a huge deal. Come join us 
Normally we'll start with a video call. We like to do a simple technical exercise on the phone on either the first or second call. If that goes well, we'll invite you to spend half a day with us working on problems together and getting to know each other a lot more.

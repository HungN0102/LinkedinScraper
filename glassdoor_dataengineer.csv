THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF ANAKHA’S FRESH THINKING 
 Creativity isn’t something that only senior managers do. In Digital and Innovation at Westminster City Council, we expect it from everyone, including our newest recruits. 
 Enter Anakha, a graduate trainee, full of energy and fresh ideas. We welcomed her input to our ‘Smart City’ initiatives, especially our Innovation Hub – a newly created space where staff, residents and businesses can meet, experiment and exchange ideas. 
 But it was what happened next that really made a difference. Anakha’s innovation space project was used to invite young people to help them find work through the 'Kickstarter' programme as well as to recruit young people to our 'Tech Lions' initiative and is regularly occupied by the Apprentice Community. 
 We are also inviting residents aged 11-19 from the Westminster Youth Council to the Hub to attend a fun ‘speed dating’ event, where they hear from different digital teams. We will continue to meet with them every week to keep them directly involved in our plans to ensure young people have a regular voice at the heart of the council. From the importance of electric vehicle charging points to new uses for tech, their insights about the kind of city they want to live in are central to our plans. 
 As for Anakha, she’s now moved into a permanent Project Manager role in the Digital and Innovation Smart City team. Supported by ongoing mentoring from colleagues, she’s already developing even bigger and better ideas. 
 
The Role: 
 
As Data Engineer, you can make your own powerful contribution. 
 That means working across our entire Digital and Innovation portfolio to greatly expand our data capabilities, in turn transforming the way we deliver crucial services. 
 
Working with our small, dedicated team of specialists, you’ll play a key role in significant data engineering projects, creating real business and user value from our data. Your work will ensure that our data as well as data shared by others is of the highest quality and highly available. 
 
As part of your duties, you’ll build and run data products and services which can consistently deliver high-quality insights. While using the best of modern data platforms, you’ll also carry out research into emerging technologies. Leading and managing external suppliers during data projects is also an important element of your work. 
 Above all, the role is a chance to significantly change the way a high-profile local authority serves its residents. We’re proud of record as a council, and this is an opportunity to build even further on our reputation. 
 Please refer to the  Job Description  for more information. 
 
About You: 
 
We’re looking for experience in a range of areas, including modern data engineering practices, working with complex data sets, running a production data service and using data development tools such as Azure Data Factory. 
 You should also have significant experience leading data projects, delivering products and services and carrying out extract, transform and load processes. 
 You’ll have strong communication skills, and proficiency in query languages, databases, programming languages, metadata management tools, data modelling and data analysis. 
 We’re also looking for people with keen problem-solving skills and a genuine passion for learning and self-development. 
 The Council and its partners are committed to achieving diverse shortlists for all vacancies at Band 4 or above to support our desire to increase the number of staff from underrepresented groups in our workforce. As part of this ambition, if you are from a Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds (B.A.ME) you can self-declare this to the hiring manager as part of our positive action commitments. 
 
What We Offer: 
 
Westminster is an amazing place. There are 250,000 diverse residents, over 50,000 vibrant and vital businesses and three-quarters-of-a-million people working here every day. Our mission is to create a fairer city. We’re an organisation that wants the very best for our residents: a supportive and safe environment, the chance to grow and learn throughout their lives, to build fantastic careers in world-leading industries, to have access to high-quality, affordable housing and to retire into the community with dignity and pride. 
 
 We want Westminster to be a place where you can make the most of your talents and thrive as an individual. That’s why we’re proud to have won Best Health & Wellbeing Initiative in the 2020/21 Business Culture Awards. By being the best you can be, you’ll help us adapt to the changing needs of our organisation and communities. 
 
 At Westminster City Council, we are passionate about our aim to be an inclusive workplace for all that reflects the communities we serve, and we believe everyone is valued. We particularly welcome applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, including B.A.ME, Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds, LGBTQ+ and those with hidden or visible disabilities. We’re committed to ensuring all our staff – regardless of gender, age, religion, sexuality, ethnicity or disability – can succeed. We value diversity and appreciate that people work in different ways. So, as a Timewise employer we work to provide flexible working arrangements and an empowering environment that enables you to be your best, that is the Westminster Way."

A highly successful global start-up within the desirable FinTech space who are on a superhero mission - to fight fraud and financial crime through the use of AI. As a result of their unique approach and high quality work, they have grown to an organisation of over 300 people and partner with the likes of KPMG, the UK government (and more) to pioneer the fight against financial crime. 
 
This continued growth has allowed them to expand globally and they now have several offices scattered across the globe in countries such as Singapore and the United States. 
 
The Position 
 
This role will offer you the opportunity to join their highly coveted data engineering team who are currently around 30 strong. With unparalleled in-house and on-the-job training, you'll become an expert in the field and be given access to cutting edge technologies while also having the opportunity to make sideward steps into other specialisms. 
 
What can I expect to be working on? 
 
 Development of ETL pipelines 
 Entity Extraction and resolution 
 Cleansing, standardising and parsing data 
 
 What's Essential? 
 
 Extensive experience in an object orientated programming language such as Java, C++, C#, Python, R or Scala (confident enough in your own skills to undertake a coding assignment) 
 A strong academic background with a Quantitative/STEM degree 
 Demonstrable experience developing ETL pipelines 
 A desire and willingness to learn to code in Spark/Scala 
 We don't like to put too much emphasis on ""years of experience"" but this opportunity would suit a junior candidate who has already gained some commercial experience within a traditional data engineering position 
 Unfortunately this opportunity would not suit a fresh graduate 
 
 Nice to have but definitely not essential 
 
 Experience in a relevant sector either within Fraud detection or entity resolution 
 Experience in the Scala coding language

Countingup is the leading UK business current account that’s helped over 50,000 customers save time and money with automatic accounting, tax estimates and instant invoicing. Our mission is a simple one, to make it easier to run a small business. 
We are a venture-backed Fintech and an early-stage startup with ambitious plans for growth and in order to do this we need talented, forward thinking individuals to join us. People make Countingup great. 
All of us here at Countingup are committed to ""The Countingup Way"" 
Do our best work 
Enjoy it 
Get it done 
The Role 
TheData Engineerwill be instrumental in establishing a data and analytics capability at Countingup. You’ll architect and build our approach to analytics, both the infrastructure to deliver it and the ways of working with it, working closely with our existing development teams. 
The Data Engineer will design the data schemas to facilitate current and future business needs, then deliver the data pipelines (ETL) to populate these, all within a cloud native environment (AWS). 
You will act as a subject matter expert on data matters, both upskilling the existing analysts and developers, as well as facilitating the future growth of the data and analytics capability. 
We’ve pulled together a lightweight, modern stack to help us deliver features quickly and resiliently: 
The Go programming language. The majority of our back end development is built using this; we like its opinionated ecosystem and small footprint 
React and React Native using Typescript. On the web for our accountant hub and internal dashboards, and as the backbone of our mobile app 
AWS. Not just for the basics of compute, storage and networking; we use services like Kinesis, Aurora and SNS as well 
Terraform. To tame all those AWS services across multiple environments 
Kubernetes. To orchestrate all of the services that power Countingup, we use Amazon’s EKS managed service. 
Docker containers. Our entire backend runs in a fleet of redundant, stateless containers. It can just as easily be run on a laptop when developing 
Continuous delivery. We deploy code changes multiple times a day, at the push of a button, thanks to our automated testing 
Key Responsibilities 
Working closely with the existing development teams, architect, build and maintain a cloud native approach to data and analytics 
Act as a subject matter expert for data and analytics across the company 
Work with other teams (Product, Compliance, Finance) to understand their needs, and ensure our approach can be evolved to meet them 
Help us to establish and build the data and analytics team we need to support our ambitious growth plans 
Experience&Skills 
A strong background in data engineering 
You have experience building and scaling business critical data analytics solutions, including defining data schemas to meet business needs 
You have experience building, maintaining and testing data pipelines 
You have hands-on experience developing an AWS based data&analytics solution 
Relevant AWS Data and Analytics certifications are desirable 
You want to help build a world-class analytics team that supports a product that makes it easier to run a small business. 
You take ownership of projects from inception to deployment 
Excellent time management, communication, and organisational skills 
Who You Are 
We’re a sociable bunch, and we enjoy each other’s company. So it’s important that you’re a great fit for our company culture. These are just some of the things that we look for. You: 
Take pride in the work you do and everything you get involved with 
Create a positive work environment 
Strive to experiment, learn and not fear failure 
Embrace new ideas and change 
Strive to understand customers' problems and solve them 
Possess a healthy amount of curiosity for the unknown with a growth mindset 
Take ownership of your work and deliver results 
You celebrate our wins 
And if you’re not sure whether you’re what we’re looking for - send us your CV anyway! We love to hear from people who are passionate about what we do, and we always take the view that a good cultural fit is just as important as ticking all the qualification boxes. 
What will you get in return? 
A chance to work with some great technology and tools in a challenging, fast paced environment, whilst being fully supported by a great team who you can learn from 
Exposure to every area of the business. You’ll be encouraged to get involved and make an impact on how we work 
A transparent and open company culture where employees are consulted on company decisions and direction

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide. 
 
We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it. 
 
We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes. 
 
And we're just getting started. 
 
The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun. 
 
We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us. 
 
 
The Role 
 
Working as part of our analytics engineering team, your role will be to provide clean, tested, well-documented and well-modelled data sets, that will to enable and empower data scientists and business users alike, via tools like Snowflake and/or Looker. 
 
You'll work with product engineering teams to ensure modelling of source data meets downstream requirements. 
 
You will maintain and develop SQL data transformation scripts, and advise and review data scientists on data modelling to achieve denormalised and aggregated output datasets. 
 
You'll work with data scientists and other analytics engineers to surface clean, intuitive datasets in our BI tool, Looker. 
 
You will be responsible for optimisation and further adoption of Looker as a data product in the business, catering to ~1500 current active users who need to discover and interact with data. 
 
 
Skillset 
 
Required 
 
 Excellent SQL skills 
 Understanding of data warehousing, data modelling concepts and structuring new data tables 
 Good working knowledge of cloud based MPP data warehousing (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) 
 
 Desired / nice to have 
 
 Experience developing in a BI tool (Looker or similar) 
 Good practical understanding of version control 
 SQL ETL/ELT knowledge, experience with DAGs to manage script dependencies 
 Python coding skills, particularly in the areas of automation & integrations 
 Good knowledge of the Looker API 
 Good communications skills across all levels of stakeholder (business & technical) 
 An ability to break down and explain complex technical concepts to business end users 
 
 
Life at Deliveroo 
 
We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. 
 
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. 
 
 
Diversity 
 
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around."

To totally reimagine residential real estate, not only how you can improve buying and selling homes, but improving the experience of tenants with a new higher level of customer service that they’ve never had before 
Create a working experience that allows employees to astound you with their innovation, passion, and empathy for each other. 
Every member of IMMO (or our “IMMORTALS” as we call them), knows that if we are to hit these goals there’s no place for hiding behind a job description or passing the buck. We look for answers, not problems, we act, not react, we work together, not on our own, and we don’t mind failing at something new if we learn something. 
Don’t get us wrong, we aren’t perfect, there’s lots for us to improve on, lots to learn, and a heck of a lot to do. If you aren’t someone who likes the uncertainty of not knowing what the answer is, like to hog the limelight instead of sharing it, and don’t have a high level of empathy for others, then that’s fine but we are not going to be right for you.

Support IMMO’s efforts to continuously deliver new products, features, and updates by developing the necessary tooling and process to facilitate frequent automated deployments. 
Play a key role in optimising both the performance and stability of IMMO’s machine learning models to build at speed and verify changes safely.

Experience with dynamic programming languages such as Python (we use it both for data science and general programming). 
Production experience with AWS or GCP, including its CLI/SDK

 A day in the life of a member in the Data Team 
Data Engineer at PrimaryBid is a very multifaceted role. It is centered around core engineering capabilities but also involves a lot of interactions with other business areas. The output we produce drives many business decision-making processes. The impact we deliver is meaningful and very tangible. A typical day usually starts with three questions: 
Can our PB users access data okay and how do we make it better - at PB we have a data platform in its nascent phase, as part of the role, we need to make sure the data pipeline and platform are running fine so that the data are available, correct and up-to-date. 
How do we better support the business - data is at the heart of everything we do here at Primarybid, which means as data experts we are involved in a broad range of programmes within the business. It could be supporting an internal UX research initiative, or setting up necessary data infrastructure in preparation for a commercial programme launch. 
What needs to be done to facilitate the insights delivery - sky's the limit to what we can achieve as a data team. As we are bringing more and more data sources, how to make those data sources useful and easy to analyse has started becoming a relevant and imminent topic. Therefore, as a data engineer you will be speaking with business stakeholders understanding their analytical requirements and then translating those requirements into data cleansing and transformation rules that can be implemented on the raw dataset. 
Play a key role in the expansion of a highly-funded FinTech 
Significant potential to progress your role as we are expanding rapidly

Technical Interview -  Once you’ve been shortlisted, we will invited you for a technical interview that will be with 2 members of the technology team, who will dig deeper into your experience. 
This interview is as much an opportunity for you to understand more about the role and the plans for the business as much as us digging deeper into your experience. 
 
 Technical Assessment -  If this role sounds exciting to you, we invite you to complete our bespoke technical task. This will give you a chance to showcase your skills. 
Final Interview -  If all goes well at the technical interview / assessment, we invite you to meet some members of the leadership team.

Lyst is a scale-up environment, combining an agile mentality with a proven business model and over a decade of experience. This provides a balance between foundations and structure, and autonomy and pace. Our goal is to be the category leading destination which every fashion shopper uses to decide what to buy. 
Data and technology sit at the heart of everything we do, and we firmly believe that we can only meet our goals by prioritising our team and culture. We give our people the freedom to drive impact and shape the future of our company, within a diverse, inclusive and high-trust environment. We don’t rely on prescriptive rules, policies and procedures to drive results. We trust the judgement and ownership of our team, and prioritise learning and career development, knowing that our success is only possible thanks to our people. Lyst was founded in London in 2010, and has raised over $160m from leading investors including Accel, Balderton, Draper Esprit, Fidelity International, and LVMH. 
 
The Role 
Lyst is looking for a Software Engineer as part of the Product Data team who can help us build upon and improve our product data pipeline that is responsible for ingesting thousands of items per second to our catalog of millions of products.

We work closely with other teams across tribes, and almost all of Lyst engineering uses our services. 
We maintain around ten or so services with a team of 4 engineers, 1 data analyst and our product manager.

THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF ANAKHA’S FRESH THINKING 
 Creativity isn’t something that only senior managers do. In Digital and Innovation at Westminster City Council, we expect it from everyone, including our newest recruits. 
 Enter Anakha, a graduate trainee, full of energy and fresh ideas. We welcomed her input to our ‘Smart City’ initiatives, especially our Innovation Hub – a newly created space where staff, residents and businesses can meet, experiment and exchange ideas. 
 But it was what happened next that really made a difference. Anakha’s innovation space project was used to invite young people to help them find work through the 'Kickstarter' programme as well as to recruit young people to our 'Tech Lions' initiative and is regularly occupied by the Apprentice Community. 
 We are also inviting residents aged 11-19 from the Westminster Youth Council to the Hub to attend a fun ‘speed dating’ event, where they hear from different digital teams. We will continue to meet with them every week to keep them directly involved in our plans to ensure young people have a regular voice at the heart of the council. From the importance of electric vehicle charging points to new uses for tech, their insights about the kind of city they want to live in are central to our plans. 
 As for Anakha, she’s now moved into a permanent Project Manager role in the Digital and Innovation Smart City team. Supported by ongoing mentoring from colleagues, she’s already developing even bigger and better ideas. 
 
The Role: 
 
As Data Engineer, you can make your own powerful contribution. 
 That means working across our entire Digital and Innovation portfolio to greatly expand our data capabilities, in turn transforming the way we deliver crucial services. 
 
Working with our small, dedicated team of specialists, you’ll play a key role in significant data engineering projects, creating real business and user value from our data. Your work will ensure that our data as well as data shared by others is of the highest quality and highly available. 
 
As part of your duties, you’ll build and run data products and services which can consistently deliver high-quality insights. While using the best of modern data platforms, you’ll also carry out research into emerging technologies. Leading and managing external suppliers during data projects is also an important element of your work. 
 Above all, the role is a chance to significantly change the way a high-profile local authority serves its residents. We’re proud of record as a council, and this is an opportunity to build even further on our reputation. 
 Please refer to the  Job Description  for more information. 
 
About You: 
 
We’re looking for experience in a range of areas, including modern data engineering practices, working with complex data sets, running a production data service and using data development tools such as Azure Data Factory. 
 You should also have significant experience leading data projects, delivering products and services and carrying out extract, transform and load processes. 
 You’ll have strong communication skills, and proficiency in query languages, databases, programming languages, metadata management tools, data modelling and data analysis. 
 We’re also looking for people with keen problem-solving skills and a genuine passion for learning and self-development. 
 The Council and its partners are committed to achieving diverse shortlists for all vacancies at Band 4 or above to support our desire to increase the number of staff from underrepresented groups in our workforce. As part of this ambition, if you are from a Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds (B.A.ME) you can self-declare this to the hiring manager as part of our positive action commitments. 
 
What We Offer: 
 
Westminster is an amazing place. There are 250,000 diverse residents, over 50,000 vibrant and vital businesses and three-quarters-of-a-million people working here every day. Our mission is to create a fairer city. We’re an organisation that wants the very best for our residents: a supportive and safe environment, the chance to grow and learn throughout their lives, to build fantastic careers in world-leading industries, to have access to high-quality, affordable housing and to retire into the community with dignity and pride. 
 
 We want Westminster to be a place where you can make the most of your talents and thrive as an individual. That’s why we’re proud to have won Best Health & Wellbeing Initiative in the 2020/21 Business Culture Awards. By being the best you can be, you’ll help us adapt to the changing needs of our organisation and communities. 
 
 At Westminster City Council, we are passionate about our aim to be an inclusive workplace for all that reflects the communities we serve, and we believe everyone is valued. We particularly welcome applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, including B.A.ME, Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds, LGBTQ+ and those with hidden or visible disabilities. We’re committed to ensuring all our staff – regardless of gender, age, religion, sexuality, ethnicity or disability – can succeed. We value diversity and appreciate that people work in different ways. So, as a Timewise employer we work to provide flexible working arrangements and an empowering environment that enables you to be your best, that is the Westminster Way."

A highly successful global start-up within the desirable FinTech space who are on a superhero mission - to fight fraud and financial crime through the use of AI. As a result of their unique approach and high quality work, they have grown to an organisation of over 300 people and partner with the likes of KPMG, the UK government (and more) to pioneer the fight against financial crime. 
 
This continued growth has allowed them to expand globally and they now have several offices scattered across the globe in countries such as Singapore and the United States. 
 
The Position 
 
This role will offer you the opportunity to join their highly coveted data engineering team who are currently around 30 strong. With unparalleled in-house and on-the-job training, you'll become an expert in the field and be given access to cutting edge technologies while also having the opportunity to make sideward steps into other specialisms. 
 
What can I expect to be working on? 
 
 Development of ETL pipelines 
 Entity Extraction and resolution 
 Cleansing, standardising and parsing data 
 
 What's Essential? 
 
 Extensive experience in an object orientated programming language such as Java, C++, C#, Python, R or Scala (confident enough in your own skills to undertake a coding assignment) 
 A strong academic background with a Quantitative/STEM degree 
 Demonstrable experience developing ETL pipelines 
 A desire and willingness to learn to code in Spark/Scala 
 We don't like to put too much emphasis on ""years of experience"" but this opportunity would suit a junior candidate who has already gained some commercial experience within a traditional data engineering position 
 Unfortunately this opportunity would not suit a fresh graduate 
 
 Nice to have but definitely not essential 
 
 Experience in a relevant sector either within Fraud detection or entity resolution 
 Experience in the Scala coding language 
 Knowledge of big data technologies such as Hadoop or Elasticsearch would be beneficial 
 
 What's in it for me? 
 
 A great company culture with a glass door rating of 4.85 from dozens of reviewers 
 Flexible working 
 Relocation support down the line to any of their global office locations 
 Competitive Salary of up to £50k + 10% bonus 
 Hybrid working with a Central London office location

Only 15% of electronics end up being recycled and an even higher percentage are left unused. These symbols of our progression as a society are responsible for our rapid environmental decay. We're here to change that. 
We build software for electronics companies who are operating producer owned models: that's when a company owns, looks after and ultimately recycles it's products. Charging it's customers to access them. Like an e-scooter sharing platform or a robotics as-a-service business. Which are are not only climate compatible but also brilliant user centric business models. 
 
Your role: 
You will have responsibility collecting, analysing and processing real-time streaming data from IoT devices and customer financial data 
You will be implementing many small views over vast sets of customer data 
You will be involved in every part of solving problems for our customers, from product to business to technology decisions being made 
You will be part of a growing product & engineering team using the latest technologies and frameworks for delivering great software 
You will help grow and influence the culture, not just in the product team but in the business overall 
You will be learning new technologies and passing on your own skillset to others in the team 
You will help architect a multi-tenant white-labelled SaaS with isolated data and access controls 
You will be given the freedom to spin up new experimental prototype services for pilot customers 
You will be given the opportunity and support to branch out into other parts of the tech stack
 
 ️ The Tech Stack: 
We’re using whatever technologies help us get working code to our customers quickly 
For our data processing and analysis we are currently weighing up the different technologies and looking for someone to bring their own experience and opinions to the table 
Currently we are using Pandas (Python) running on Databricks for rapid prototyping 
For our platform we are using NextJS (React and NodeJS) with our APIs managed through GraphQL 
Think there are some key tools we should be using? Let us know!
 
 Your experience: 
You have experience processing streamed data in realtime as well as working on ETL pipelines 
You have have an understanding of different data engineering technologies and solutions that are available to process and analyse vast quantities of data and where they can be used effectively (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, AirFlow, FiveTran, AWS Kinesis, GCP Dataflow, Databricks, etc.) 
You understand the importance of testing components, utilising unit, integration, and end-to-end testing models and continuous integration and deployment workflows 
Twist is an equal opportunities employer and we would encourage you to apply even if you feel like you do not tick all the boxes. 
Taking care of yourself 
Health and happiness  - We want to support our employees health and happiness. Everyone's version of that is different so we're trusting you to spend your £100 per month allowance on what makes sense for you. 
Time off  - We don’t have set holiday days. We trust you to act in the best interest of the company, to us that means being well rested. We want you to have control and be able to observe what’s important to you — including taking time off when your mind and body need a break. Some people need a bit more of a push when it comes to taking holiday so your manager will make sure you take at least 25 days off a year and generally gloat about their latest hiking trip. 
Doing your best work 
Working together  - We are working in a hybrid model where we have set days in the office and on the other days you can work where you want to. Right now we're loving having set time to workshop and collaborate, where we make sure the intensity is high. 
Diversity matters  - We know that no single discipline has all the answers needed to help us realise the economic and environmental benefits of our vision. We’ve found that the best ideas come from dedicated collaboration between different fields. We firmly believe that to do that well, we need to build a diverse, empowered and cross functional team.
 High performance environment  - We have a real dedication to our mission. We know for us to realise it, that we need to push each other to do our best work. This means supporting and motivating each other to be braver and communicating clearly how we can each improve. 
Trust  - We value flat hierarchies, clear communication full ownership and responsibility. We want you to bring forward anything that you think will help us be a better business. To feel empowered to make big bets that can have a major impact and be comfortable to shine a light on your mistakes if it doesn't come off.

The team currently consists of 5 experienced data engineers and scientists, who are building data and machine learning products for our client-facing platform and internal teams. The team sits at the heart of the business, working across our ratings, product and technology teams. This role will also work closely with our Earth Observations (EO) research team and is focused on building scalable data pipelines for our geospatial data products. We prefer an engineer with experience handling geospatial data sets for this role, but welcome applications from experienced engineers who are looking to get into geospatial data engineering but don’t have that experience yet. As a data team, we have a bias towards shipping products, staying close to our internal and external customers, and owning our infrastructure and deployments end-to-end. This is a team that follows software engineering best practices closely: no production code found in Jupyter notebooks here! Our data stack looks as follows: AWS as our cloud infrastructure provider. Snowflake as our central data warehouse for tabular data. AWS S3 is used for any non-tabular data (e.g., satellite imagery data). dbt for building SQL-style data models and taking care of the ‘T’ in ELT. Python jobs for non-SQL data transformations, using packages like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and many more. Prefect as our workflow orchestration manager, with our jobs executed on AWS ECS. Metabase as a dashboarding solution for end-users. GitHub Actions for CI / CD. As a geospatial data engineer, you will be deeply embedded in our data and EO teams.

You’re welcome to work in our London-based office, but we very much welcome applications remotely if you can work GMT +/- 3 hours. You’d be reporting to our Chief Data Strategist Thomas, who joined recently from data and machine learning consultancy QuantumBlack and McKinsey & Co, and represents the data organisation at the executive level. Responsibilities:  You will be an individual contributor on our central data team, focused on scoping and building geospatial data products to be deployed on our carbon markets platform. You will be charged with finding ways to monitor and maintain data flows, enable self-service analysis to business users, and to create and improve scalable data pipelines. You will build automated data pipelines that collect, and manipulate large data sets (such as optical satellite imagery, SAR and LiDAR, climate data and others). You’ll be our ideal candidate if:  You care deeply about the climate and carbon markets and are excited by solutions for decarbonizing our economy. You have 3+ years of experience in building data pipelines in production for (geospatial) data engineering and machine learning use cases. You have experience with handling raster and vector data formats (GeoJSONs, Shapefiles, etc) and geospatial SQL and Python packages (e.g., PostGIS, xarray, geopandas, rasterio, shapely, gdal). You have experience with using a workflow orchestration tool (e.g., Prefect, Dagster, Airflow), cloud platforms (we use AWS, but experience with any cloud platform will do), and the Python scientific computing stack (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pandas, etc). You can write clean, maintainable, scalable, and robust code in Python and SQL, and are familiar with collaborative coding best practices (e.g., for Python PEP8 code style, unit testing, continuous integration tools such as flake8, black, isort, etc). Bonus points (but we’d still like to hear from you if you don’t have experience in any of these) You have practical knowledge of software engineering concepts and best practices, inc. DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps. You have experience in building and deploying deep learning models for computer vision use-cases. Research has shown that women are less likely than men to apply for a role if they don’t have experience in 100% of the requirements outlined in a job description. Please know that even if you don’t have experience in all the areas above but think you could do a great job and are excited about shaping company culture, finding great people, and building great teams, we’d love to hear from you!

Inventory planning involves many algorithms to buy inventory in the right quantities, at the right frequencies, from the right vendors, and assigning to the best warehouse to fulfill customer demand to optimize long term free cash flow for Amazon. Our system lives at the heart of these algorithms, keeping up with the rapid pace of optimization improvements and simulating how they interact with each other. We simulate what these systems will do for months into the future, predicting inventory flows and key operational and financial metrics across the network.

We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payments network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before. 
 
We're very fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction. 
 
We've always enabled remote working as a company; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission. 
 
About the role and the team 
 
We're looking for someone who shares our vision, identifies with our desire to reinvent payments, and will help guide us through our growth and establish our position as a direct competitor to Visa and Mastercard. Working with our Data Engineering Lead, you'll participate in setting the direction of the company's data hub and products, you'll be part of a team where everyone has a voice. 
 
As a Senior Data Engineer at Banked, you'll be working closely with the Data Lead and wider engineers to build our new datahub. You'll provide the infrastructure and tools to our internal data producers and consumers and also provide the basis for our data-based products. 
 
We don't expect people to be experts with all of the technology we use or to immediately be able to pick up all the tasks we might ask of them. We want to build an environment where people can learn and grow openly, where failure is accepted as a part of learning and there's enough support to help people be successful. 
 
You will 
 Work with partners from analytics and engineering teams to build best-in-class data platform solutions including designing and developing the infrastructure for data pipeline orchestration; designing and implementing tools and microservices for engineering teams to self-serve and create their own data pipelines and data consumption use cases. 
 Help to define the company's data engineering roadmap and make sure it's implemented using the best suitable technologies. 
 Collaborate with various stakeholders across the company to advise and make sure our data infrastructure and tooling meet the company's needs. 
 Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes as we grow. 
 You may be a good fit if you have 
 Significant experience in communicating and working with software teams, and working towards building inclusive, fun environments. 
 The ability to reason intelligently about complex, uncertain problems and reduce them down to clean, simple abstractions through well-designed systems. 
 Experience with production environments/data platforms serving production. 
 Experience with ETL pipelines design, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance. 
 Highly skilled with SQL, experienced with MPP columnar databases like Snowflake, Redshift, Bigquery, etc. 
 Experience with distributed databases such as cassandra, cloud spanner etc.

 Any combination of the following would make your application stand out 
 Experience in payments, fintech, or in any mission-critical/regulated industry. 
 Experience working with GCP infrastructure and data products. 
 Experience with k8s. 
 Experience in mentoring engineers. 
 The interview process 
 
The interview process will focus on three areas: your experience and taking on technical challenges; your technical skills; and how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team. 
 
We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not. 
 
All interviews will take place remotely, via Zoom. 
 
Your interview will be broken down into four stages, scheduled separately and with feedback after each: 
 
 An initial call to outline the company and the role, and for you to share your career experience. If there's a good fit to move forward, we'll continue with a technical interview. 
 A technical interview where you will get a chance to share your technical knowledge in a little more depth. We'll outline a few high-level technical problems and discuss possible solutions together. 
 A second technical interview focused more on system architecture. 
 A final stage for you to talk with our Head of People about the high-level direction of the company, what you want to achieve with your career, and how Banked can help you achieve it. At this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate. 
 
 After this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate. You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with our VP of Engineering to understand our decision."

 Mission Driven - We have a real dedication to our mission. We know for us to realise it, that we need to push each other to do our best work. This means supporting and motivating each other to be braver and communicating clearly how we can each improve. 
Trust  - We value flat hierarchies, clear communication full ownership and responsibility. We want you to bring forward anything that you think will help us be a better business. To feel empowered to make big bets that can have a major impact and be comfortable to shine a light on your mistakes if it doesn't come off.

Only 15% of electronics end up being recycled and an even higher percentage are left unused. These symbols of our progression as a society are responsible for our rapid environmental decay. We're here to change that. 
We build software for electronics companies who are operating producer owned models: that's when a company owns, looks after and ultimately recycles it's products. Charging it's customers to access them. Like an e-scooter sharing platform or a robotics as-a-service business. Which are are not only climate compatible but also brilliant user centric business models. 
 
Your role: 
You will have responsibility collecting, analysing and processing real-time streaming data from IoT devices and customer financial data 
You will be implementing many small views over vast sets of customer data 
You will be involved in every part of solving problems for our customers, from product to business to technology decisions being made 
You will be part of a growing product & engineering team using the latest technologies and frameworks for delivering great software 
You will help grow and influence the culture, not just in the product team but in the business overall 
You will be learning new technologies and passing on your own skillset to others in the team 
You will help architect a multi-tenant white-labelled SaaS with isolated data and access controls 
You will be given the freedom to spin up new experimental prototype services for pilot customers 
You will be given the opportunity and support to branch out into other parts of the tech stack
 
 ️ The Tech Stack: 
We’re using whatever technologies help us get working code to our customers quickly 
For our data processing and analysis we are currently weighing up the different technologies and looking for someone to bring their own experience and opinions to the table 
Currently we are using Pandas (Python) running on Databricks for rapid prototyping 
For our platform we are using NextJS (React and NodeJS) with our APIs managed through GraphQL 
Think there are some key tools we should be using? Let us know!
 
 Your experience: 
You have experience processing streamed data in realtime as well as working on ETL pipelines 
You have have an understanding of different data engineering technologies and solutions that are available to process and analyse vast quantities of data and where they can be used effectively (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, AirFlow, FiveTran, AWS Kinesis, GCP Dataflow, Databricks, etc.) 
You understand the importance of testing components, utilising unit, integration, and end-to-end testing models and continuous integration and deployment workflows 
Twist is an equal opportunities employer and we would encourage you to apply even if you feel like you do not tick all the boxes. Taking care of yourself 
Health and happiness  - We want to support our employees health and happiness. Everyone's version of that is different so we're trusting you to spend your £100 per month allowance on what makes sense for you. 
Time off  - We don’t have set holiday days. We trust you to act in the best interest of the company, to us that means being well rested. We want you to have control and be able to observe what’s important to you — including taking time off when your mind and body need a break. Some people need a bit more of a push when it comes to taking holiday so your manager will make sure you take at least 25 days off a year and generally gloat about their latest hiking trip. 
Doing your best work 
 
Working together  - We are working in a hybrid model where we have set days in the office and on the other days you can work where you want to. Right now we're loving having set time to workshop and collaborate, where we make sure the intensity is high. 
Diversity matters  - We know that no single discipline has all the answers needed to help us realise the economic and environmental benefits of our vision. We’ve found that the best ideas come from dedicated collaboration between different fields. We firmly believe that to do that well, we need to build a diverse, empowered and cross functional team.
 Mission Driven - We have a real dedication to our mission. We know for us to realise it, that we need to push each other to do our best work. This means supporting and motivating each other to be braver and communicating clearly how we can each improve. 
Trust  - We value flat hierarchies, clear communication full ownership and responsibility. We want you to bring forward anything that you think will help us be a better business. To feel empowered to make big bets that can have a major impact and be comfortable to shine a light on your mistakes if it doesn't come off. 
Flexibility -  We value being flexible in our approach to operate allowing for a remote first environment, flexible hours and a work from everywhere setup to make sure you can do your best work both at Twist but also at home.

Only 15% of electronics end up being recycled and an even higher percentage are left unused. These symbols of our progression as a society are responsible for our rapid environmental decay. We're here to change that. 
We build software for electronics companies who are operating producer owned models: that's when a company owns, looks after and ultimately recycles it's products. Charging it's customers to access them. Like an e-scooter sharing platform or a robotics as-a-service business. Which are are not only climate compatible but also brilliant user centric business models. 
 
Your role: 
You will have responsibility collecting, analysing and processing real-time streaming data from IoT devices and customer financial data

We’re using whatever technologies help us get working code to our customers quickly 
For our data processing and analysis we are currently weighing up the different technologies and looking for someone to bring their own experience and opinions to the table

Think there are some key tools we should be using? Let us know!
 
 Your experience: 
You have experience processing streamed data in realtime as well as working on ETL pipelines 
You have have an understanding of different data engineering technologies and solutions that are available to process and analyse vast quantities of data and where they can be used effectively (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, AirFlow, FiveTran, AWS Kinesis, GCP Dataflow, Databricks, etc.)

Time off  - We don’t have set holiday days. We trust you to act in the best interest of the company, to us that means being well rested. We want you to have control and be able to observe what’s important to you — including taking time off when your mind and body need a break. Some people need a bit more of a push when it comes to taking holiday so your manager will make sure you take at least 25 days off a year and generally gloat about their latest hiking trip.

Working together  - We are working in a hybrid model where we have set days in the office and on the other days you can work where you want to. Right now we're loving having set time to workshop and collaborate, where we make sure the intensity is high. 
Diversity matters  - We know that no single discipline has all the answers needed to help us realise the economic and environmental benefits of our vision. We’ve found that the best ideas come from dedicated collaboration between different fields. We firmly believe that to do that well, we need to build a diverse, empowered and cross functional team.
 Mission Driven - We have a real dedication to our mission. We know for us to realise it, that we need to push each other to do our best work. This means supporting and motivating each other to be braver and communicating clearly how we can each improve. 
Trust  - We value flat hierarchies, clear communication full ownership and responsibility. We want you to bring forward anything that you think will help us be a better business. To feel empowered to make big bets that can have a major impact and be comfortable to shine a light on your mistakes if it doesn't come off. 
Flexibility -  We value being flexible in our approach to operate allowing for a remote first environment, flexible hours and a work from everywhere setup to make sure you can do your best work both at Twist but also at home.

Only 15% of electronics end up being recycled and an even higher percentage are left unused. These symbols of our progression as a society are responsible for our rapid environmental decay. We're here to change that. 
We build software for electronics companies who are operating producer owned models: that's when a company owns, looks after and ultimately recycles it's products. Charging it's customers to access them. Like an e-scooter sharing platform or a robotics as-a-service business. Which are are not only climate compatible but also brilliant user centric business models. 
 
Your role: 
You will have responsibility collecting, analysing and processing real-time streaming data from IoT devices and customer financial data 
You will be implementing many small views over vast sets of customer data 
You will be involved in every part of solving problems for our customers, from product to business to technology decisions being made 
You will be part of a growing product & engineering team using the latest technologies and frameworks for delivering great software 
You will help grow and influence the culture, not just in the product team but in the business overall 
You will be learning new technologies and passing on your own skillset to others in the team 
You will help architect a multi-tenant white-labelled SaaS with isolated data and access controls 
You will be given the freedom to spin up new experimental prototype services for pilot customers 
You will be given the opportunity and support to branch out into other parts of the tech stack
 
 ️ The Tech Stack: 
We’re using whatever technologies help us get working code to our customers quickly 
For our data processing and analysis we are currently weighing up the different technologies and looking for someone to bring their own experience and opinions to the table 
Currently we are using Pandas (Python) running on Databricks for rapid prototyping 
For our platform we are using NextJS (React and NodeJS) with our APIs managed through GraphQL 
Think there are some key tools we should be using? Let us know!
 
 Your experience: 
You have experience processing streamed data in realtime as well as working on ETL pipelines 
You have have an understanding of different data engineering technologies and solutions that are available to process and analyse vast quantities of data and where they can be used effectively (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, AirFlow, FiveTran, AWS Kinesis, GCP Dataflow, Databricks, etc.) 
You understand the importance of testing components, utilising unit, integration, and end-to-end testing models and continuous integration and deployment workflows 
Twist is an equal opportunities employer and we would encourage you to apply even if you feel like you do not tick all the boxes. Taking care of yourself 
Health and happiness  - We want to support our employees health and happiness. Everyone's version of that is different so we're trusting you to spend your £100 per month allowance on what makes sense for you. 
Time off  - We don’t have set holiday days. We trust you to act in the best interest of the company, to us that means being well rested. We want you to have control and be able to observe what’s important to you — including taking time off when your mind and body need a break. Some people need a bit more of a push when it comes to taking holiday so your manager will make sure you take at least 25 days off a year and generally gloat about their latest hiking trip. 
Doing your best work 
 
Working together  - We are working in a hybrid model where we have set days in the office and on the other days you can work where you want to. Right now we're loving having set time to workshop and collaborate, where we make sure the intensity is high. 
Diversity matters  - We know that no single discipline has all the answers needed to help us realise the economic and environmental benefits of our vision. We’ve found that the best ideas come from dedicated collaboration between different fields. We firmly believe that to do that well, we need to build a diverse, empowered and cross functional team.
 Mission Driven - We have a real dedication to our mission. We know for us to realise it, that we need to push each other to do our best work. This means supporting and motivating each other to be braver and communicating clearly how we can each improve. 
Trust  - We value flat hierarchies, clear communication full ownership and responsibility. We want you to bring forward anything that you think will help us be a better business. To feel empowered to make big bets that can have a major impact and be comfortable to shine a light on your mistakes if it doesn't come off. 
Flexibility -  We value being flexible in our approach to operate allowing for a remote first environment, flexible hours and a work from everywhere setup to make sure you can do your best work both at Twist but also at home.

Only 15% of electronics end up being recycled and an even higher percentage are left unused. These symbols of our progression as a society are responsible for our rapid environmental decay. We're here to change that. 
We build software for electronics companies who are operating producer owned models: that's when a company owns, looks after and ultimately recycles it's products. Charging it's customers to access them. Like an e-scooter sharing platform or a robotics as-a-service business. Which are are not only climate compatible but also brilliant user centric business models. 
 
Your role: 
You will have responsibility collecting, analysing and processing real-time streaming data from IoT devices and customer financial data 
You will be implementing many small views over vast sets of customer data 
You will be involved in every part of solving problems for our customers, from product to business to technology decisions being made 
You will be part of a growing product & engineering team using the latest technologies and frameworks for delivering great software 
You will help grow and influence the culture, not just in the product team but in the business overall 
You will be learning new technologies and passing on your own skillset to others in the team 
You will help architect a multi-tenant white-labelled SaaS with isolated data and access controls 
You will be given the freedom to spin up new experimental prototype services for pilot customers 
You will be given the opportunity and support to branch out into other parts of the tech stack
 
 ️ The Tech Stack: 
We’re using whatever technologies help us get working code to our customers quickly 
For our data processing and analysis we are currently weighing up the different technologies and looking for someone to bring their own experience and opinions to the table 
Currently we are using Pandas (Python) running on Databricks for rapid prototyping 
For our platform we are using NextJS (React and NodeJS) with our APIs managed through GraphQL 
Think there are some key tools we should be using? Let us know!
 
 Your experience: 
You have experience processing streamed data in realtime as well as working on ETL pipelines 
You have have an understanding of different data engineering technologies and solutions that are available to process and analyse vast quantities of data and where they can be used effectively (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, AirFlow, FiveTran, AWS Kinesis, GCP Dataflow, Databricks, etc.) 
You understand the importance of testing components, utilising unit, integration, and end-to-end testing models and continuous integration and deployment workflows 
Twist is an equal opportunities employer and we would encourage you to apply even if you feel like you do not tick all the boxes. Taking care of yourself 
Health and happiness  - We want to support our employees health and happiness. Everyone's version of that is different so we're trusting you to spend your £100 per month allowance on what makes sense for you. 
Time off  - We don’t have set holiday days. We trust you to act in the best interest of the company, to us that means being well rested. We want you to have control and be able to observe what’s important to you — including taking time off when your mind and body need a break. Some people need a bit more of a push when it comes to taking holiday so your manager will make sure you take at least 25 days off a year and generally gloat about their latest hiking trip. 
Doing your best work 
 
Working together  - We are working in a hybrid model where we have set days in the office and on the other days you can work where you want to. Right now we're loving having set time to workshop and collaborate, where we make sure the intensity is high. 
Diversity matters  - We know that no single discipline has all the answers needed to help us realise the economic and environmental benefits of our vision. We’ve found that the best ideas come from dedicated collaboration between different fields. We firmly believe that to do that well, we need to build a diverse, empowered and cross functional team.
 Mission Driven - We have a real dedication to our mission. We know for us to realise it, that we need to push each other to do our best work. This means supporting and motivating each other to be braver and communicating clearly how we can each improve. 
Trust  - We value flat hierarchies, clear communication full ownership and responsibility. We want you to bring forward anything that you think will help us be a better business. To feel empowered to make big bets that can have a major impact and be comfortable to shine a light on your mistakes if it doesn't come off. 
Flexibility -  We value being flexible in our approach to operate allowing for a remote first environment, flexible hours and a work from everywhere setup to make sure you can do your best work both at Twist but also at home.

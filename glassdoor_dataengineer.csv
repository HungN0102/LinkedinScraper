THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF ANAKHA’S FRESH THINKING 
 Creativity isn’t something that only senior managers do. In Digital and Innovation at Westminster City Council, we expect it from everyone, including our newest recruits. 
 Enter Anakha, a graduate trainee, full of energy and fresh ideas. We welcomed her input to our ‘Smart City’ initiatives, especially our Innovation Hub – a newly created space where staff, residents and businesses can meet, experiment and exchange ideas. 
 But it was what happened next that really made a difference. Anakha’s innovation space project was used to invite young people to help them find work through the 'Kickstarter' programme as well as to recruit young people to our 'Tech Lions' initiative and is regularly occupied by the Apprentice Community. 
 We are also inviting residents aged 11-19 from the Westminster Youth Council to the Hub to attend a fun ‘speed dating’ event, where they hear from different digital teams. We will continue to meet with them every week to keep them directly involved in our plans to ensure young people have a regular voice at the heart of the council. From the importance of electric vehicle charging points to new uses for tech, their insights about the kind of city they want to live in are central to our plans. 
 As for Anakha, she’s now moved into a permanent Project Manager role in the Digital and Innovation Smart City team. Supported by ongoing mentoring from colleagues, she’s already developing even bigger and better ideas. 
 
The Role: 
 
As Data Engineer, you can make your own powerful contribution. 
 That means working across our entire Digital and Innovation portfolio to greatly expand our data capabilities, in turn transforming the way we deliver crucial services. 
 
Working with our small, dedicated team of specialists, you’ll play a key role in significant data engineering projects, creating real business and user value from our data. Your work will ensure that our data as well as data shared by others is of the highest quality and highly available. 
 
As part of your duties, you’ll build and run data products and services which can consistently deliver high-quality insights. While using the best of modern data platforms, you’ll also carry out research into emerging technologies. Leading and managing external suppliers during data projects is also an important element of your work. 
 Above all, the role is a chance to significantly change the way a high-profile local authority serves its residents. We’re proud of record as a council, and this is an opportunity to build even further on our reputation. 
 Please refer to the  Job Description  for more information. 
 
About You: 
 
We’re looking for experience in a range of areas, including modern data engineering practices, working with complex data sets, running a production data service and using data development tools such as Azure Data Factory. 
 You should also have significant experience leading data projects, delivering products and services and carrying out extract, transform and load processes. 
 You’ll have strong communication skills, and proficiency in query languages, databases, programming languages, metadata management tools, data modelling and data analysis. 
 We’re also looking for people with keen problem-solving skills and a genuine passion for learning and self-development. 
 The Council and its partners are committed to achieving diverse shortlists for all vacancies at Band 4 or above to support our desire to increase the number of staff from underrepresented groups in our workforce. As part of this ambition, if you are from a Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds (B.A.ME) you can self-declare this to the hiring manager as part of our positive action commitments. 
 
What We Offer: 
 
Westminster is an amazing place. There are 250,000 diverse residents, over 50,000 vibrant and vital businesses and three-quarters-of-a-million people working here every day. Our mission is to create a fairer city. We’re an organisation that wants the very best for our residents: a supportive and safe environment, the chance to grow and learn throughout their lives, to build fantastic careers in world-leading industries, to have access to high-quality, affordable housing and to retire into the community with dignity and pride. 
 
 We want Westminster to be a place where you can make the most of your talents and thrive as an individual. That’s why we’re proud to have won Best Health & Wellbeing Initiative in the 2020/21 Business Culture Awards. By being the best you can be, you’ll help us adapt to the changing needs of our organisation and communities. 
 
 At Westminster City Council, we are passionate about our aim to be an inclusive workplace for all that reflects the communities we serve, and we believe everyone is valued. We particularly welcome applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, including B.A.ME, Black, Asian and Multiple Ethnic backgrounds, LGBTQ+ and those with hidden or visible disabilities. We’re committed to ensuring all our staff – regardless of gender, age, religion, sexuality, ethnicity or disability – can succeed. We value diversity and appreciate that people work in different ways. So, as a Timewise employer we work to provide flexible working arrangements and an empowering environment that enables you to be your best, that is the Westminster Way."

A highly successful global start-up within the desirable FinTech space who are on a superhero mission - to fight fraud and financial crime through the use of AI. As a result of their unique approach and high quality work, they have grown to an organisation of over 300 people and partner with the likes of KPMG, the UK government (and more) to pioneer the fight against financial crime. 
 
This continued growth has allowed them to expand globally and they now have several offices scattered across the globe in countries such as Singapore and the United States. 
 
The Position 
 
This role will offer you the opportunity to join their highly coveted data engineering team who are currently around 30 strong. With unparalleled in-house and on-the-job training, you'll become an expert in the field and be given access to cutting edge technologies while also having the opportunity to make sideward steps into other specialisms. 
 
What can I expect to be working on? 
 
 Development of ETL pipelines 
 Entity Extraction and resolution 
 Cleansing, standardising and parsing data 
 
 What's Essential? 
 
 Extensive experience in an object orientated programming language such as Java, C++, C#, Python, R or Scala (confident enough in your own skills to undertake a coding assignment) 
 A strong academic background with a Quantitative/STEM degree 
 Demonstrable experience developing ETL pipelines 
 A desire and willingness to learn to code in Spark/Scala 
 We don't like to put too much emphasis on ""years of experience"" but this opportunity would suit a junior candidate who has already gained some commercial experience within a traditional data engineering position 
 Unfortunately this opportunity would not suit a fresh graduate 
 
 Nice to have but definitely not essential 
 
 Experience in a relevant sector either within Fraud detection or entity resolution 
 Experience in the Scala coding language

Countingup is the leading UK business current account that’s helped over 50,000 customers save time and money with automatic accounting, tax estimates and instant invoicing. Our mission is a simple one, to make it easier to run a small business. 
We are a venture-backed Fintech and an early-stage startup with ambitious plans for growth and in order to do this we need talented, forward thinking individuals to join us. People make Countingup great. 
All of us here at Countingup are committed to ""The Countingup Way"" 
Do our best work 
Enjoy it 
Get it done 
The Role 
TheData Engineerwill be instrumental in establishing a data and analytics capability at Countingup. You’ll architect and build our approach to analytics, both the infrastructure to deliver it and the ways of working with it, working closely with our existing development teams. 
The Data Engineer will design the data schemas to facilitate current and future business needs, then deliver the data pipelines (ETL) to populate these, all within a cloud native environment (AWS). 
You will act as a subject matter expert on data matters, both upskilling the existing analysts and developers, as well as facilitating the future growth of the data and analytics capability. 
We’ve pulled together a lightweight, modern stack to help us deliver features quickly and resiliently: 
The Go programming language. The majority of our back end development is built using this; we like its opinionated ecosystem and small footprint 
React and React Native using Typescript. On the web for our accountant hub and internal dashboards, and as the backbone of our mobile app 
AWS. Not just for the basics of compute, storage and networking; we use services like Kinesis, Aurora and SNS as well 
Terraform. To tame all those AWS services across multiple environments 
Kubernetes. To orchestrate all of the services that power Countingup, we use Amazon’s EKS managed service. 
Docker containers. Our entire backend runs in a fleet of redundant, stateless containers. It can just as easily be run on a laptop when developing 
Continuous delivery. We deploy code changes multiple times a day, at the push of a button, thanks to our automated testing 
Key Responsibilities 
Working closely with the existing development teams, architect, build and maintain a cloud native approach to data and analytics 
Act as a subject matter expert for data and analytics across the company 
Work with other teams (Product, Compliance, Finance) to understand their needs, and ensure our approach can be evolved to meet them 
Help us to establish and build the data and analytics team we need to support our ambitious growth plans 
Experience&Skills 
A strong background in data engineering 
You have experience building and scaling business critical data analytics solutions, including defining data schemas to meet business needs 
You have experience building, maintaining and testing data pipelines 
You have hands-on experience developing an AWS based data&analytics solution 
Relevant AWS Data and Analytics certifications are desirable 
You want to help build a world-class analytics team that supports a product that makes it easier to run a small business. 
You take ownership of projects from inception to deployment 
Excellent time management, communication, and organisational skills 
Who You Are 
We’re a sociable bunch, and we enjoy each other’s company. So it’s important that you’re a great fit for our company culture. These are just some of the things that we look for. You: 
Take pride in the work you do and everything you get involved with 
Create a positive work environment 
Strive to experiment, learn and not fear failure 
Embrace new ideas and change 
Strive to understand customers' problems and solve them 
Possess a healthy amount of curiosity for the unknown with a growth mindset 
Take ownership of your work and deliver results 
You celebrate our wins 
And if you’re not sure whether you’re what we’re looking for - send us your CV anyway! We love to hear from people who are passionate about what we do, and we always take the view that a good cultural fit is just as important as ticking all the qualification boxes. 
What will you get in return? 
A chance to work with some great technology and tools in a challenging, fast paced environment, whilst being fully supported by a great team who you can learn from 
Exposure to every area of the business. You’ll be encouraged to get involved and make an impact on how we work 
A transparent and open company culture where employees are consulted on company decisions and direction

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide. 
 
We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it. 
 
We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes. 
 
And we're just getting started. 
 
The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun. 
 
We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us. 
 
 
The Role 
 
Working as part of our analytics engineering team, your role will be to provide clean, tested, well-documented and well-modelled data sets, that will to enable and empower data scientists and business users alike, via tools like Snowflake and/or Looker. 
 
You'll work with product engineering teams to ensure modelling of source data meets downstream requirements. 
 
You will maintain and develop SQL data transformation scripts, and advise and review data scientists on data modelling to achieve denormalised and aggregated output datasets. 
 
You'll work with data scientists and other analytics engineers to surface clean, intuitive datasets in our BI tool, Looker. 
 
You will be responsible for optimisation and further adoption of Looker as a data product in the business, catering to ~1500 current active users who need to discover and interact with data. 
 
 
Skillset 
 
Required 
 
 Excellent SQL skills 
 Understanding of data warehousing, data modelling concepts and structuring new data tables 
 Good working knowledge of cloud based MPP data warehousing (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) 
 
 Desired / nice to have 
 
 Experience developing in a BI tool (Looker or similar) 
 Good practical understanding of version control 
 SQL ETL/ELT knowledge, experience with DAGs to manage script dependencies 
 Python coding skills, particularly in the areas of automation & integrations 
 Good knowledge of the Looker API 
 Good communications skills across all levels of stakeholder (business & technical) 
 An ability to break down and explain complex technical concepts to business end users 
 
 
Life at Deliveroo 
 
We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. 
 
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. 
 
 
Diversity 
 
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around."

To totally reimagine residential real estate, not only how you can improve buying and selling homes, but improving the experience of tenants with a new higher level of customer service that they’ve never had before 
Create a working experience that allows employees to astound you with their innovation, passion, and empathy for each other. 
Every member of IMMO (or our “IMMORTALS” as we call them), knows that if we are to hit these goals there’s no place for hiding behind a job description or passing the buck. We look for answers, not problems, we act, not react, we work together, not on our own, and we don’t mind failing at something new if we learn something. 
Don’t get us wrong, we aren’t perfect, there’s lots for us to improve on, lots to learn, and a heck of a lot to do. If you aren’t someone who likes the uncertainty of not knowing what the answer is, like to hog the limelight instead of sharing it, and don’t have a high level of empathy for others, then that’s fine but we are not going to be right for you.

Support IMMO’s efforts to continuously deliver new products, features, and updates by developing the necessary tooling and process to facilitate frequent automated deployments. 
Play a key role in optimising both the performance and stability of IMMO’s machine learning models to build at speed and verify changes safely.

Experience with dynamic programming languages such as Python (we use it both for data science and general programming). 
Production experience with AWS or GCP, including its CLI/SDK

 A day in the life of a member in the Data Team 
Data Engineer at PrimaryBid is a very multifaceted role. It is centered around core engineering capabilities but also involves a lot of interactions with other business areas. The output we produce drives many business decision-making processes. The impact we deliver is meaningful and very tangible. A typical day usually starts with three questions: 
Can our PB users access data okay and how do we make it better - at PB we have a data platform in its nascent phase, as part of the role, we need to make sure the data pipeline and platform are running fine so that the data are available, correct and up-to-date. 
How do we better support the business - data is at the heart of everything we do here at Primarybid, which means as data experts we are involved in a broad range of programmes within the business. It could be supporting an internal UX research initiative, or setting up necessary data infrastructure in preparation for a commercial programme launch. 
What needs to be done to facilitate the insights delivery - sky's the limit to what we can achieve as a data team. As we are bringing more and more data sources, how to make those data sources useful and easy to analyse has started becoming a relevant and imminent topic. Therefore, as a data engineer you will be speaking with business stakeholders understanding their analytical requirements and then translating those requirements into data cleansing and transformation rules that can be implemented on the raw dataset. 
Play a key role in the expansion of a highly-funded FinTech 
Significant potential to progress your role as we are expanding rapidly

Technical Interview -  Once you’ve been shortlisted, we will invited you for a technical interview that will be with 2 members of the technology team, who will dig deeper into your experience. 
This interview is as much an opportunity for you to understand more about the role and the plans for the business as much as us digging deeper into your experience. 
 
 Technical Assessment -  If this role sounds exciting to you, we invite you to complete our bespoke technical task. This will give you a chance to showcase your skills. 
Final Interview -  If all goes well at the technical interview / assessment, we invite you to meet some members of the leadership team.

Lyst is a scale-up environment, combining an agile mentality with a proven business model and over a decade of experience. This provides a balance between foundations and structure, and autonomy and pace. Our goal is to be the category leading destination which every fashion shopper uses to decide what to buy. 
Data and technology sit at the heart of everything we do, and we firmly believe that we can only meet our goals by prioritising our team and culture. We give our people the freedom to drive impact and shape the future of our company, within a diverse, inclusive and high-trust environment. We don’t rely on prescriptive rules, policies and procedures to drive results. We trust the judgement and ownership of our team, and prioritise learning and career development, knowing that our success is only possible thanks to our people. Lyst was founded in London in 2010, and has raised over $160m from leading investors including Accel, Balderton, Draper Esprit, Fidelity International, and LVMH. 
 
The Role 
Lyst is looking for a Software Engineer as part of the Product Data team who can help us build upon and improve our product data pipeline that is responsible for ingesting thousands of items per second to our catalog of millions of products.

We work closely with other teams across tribes, and almost all of Lyst engineering uses our services. 
We maintain around ten or so services with a team of 4 engineers, 1 data analyst and our product manager.

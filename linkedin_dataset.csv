              MOO set out to shake up the world of print back in 2006. And we’ve come a long way since. Today we’re a 300 + strong team (we’re thinking of getting matching jackets) who create print and digital products for companies of all sizes – from Google and AirBnB to the guy who makes those amazing prints you found at a craft fair.

Our global HQ is in London, UK, while we also have premises in Dagenham. In the US, you’ll find us in Boston, MA, as well as Lincoln, RI and Denver, CO.

We’re making new and exciting things – and we could really do with your help.

We are the Data Engineering (DE) team at MOO. Our team is responsible for building the core data platform used by MOO to deliver, monitor and support insights and analysis.

You will join a very technologically independent and exciting young team to help us achieve our objectives. You will work closely with the DevOps team using a self-service cloud platform and the Analytics team who turns data into meaningful and actionable dashboards for our business stakeholders.

We are a team in which everyone’s perspective is valued, and nobody is afraid of new ideas, tackling challenges together, and learning from mistakes. We really care about continually improving, and we love the open exchange of knowledge amongst our members.

We use Zoom for all of our calls and meetings. That creates a regular office day feeling giving us the chance to see each other's faces - sometimes it involves a smiling toddler walking into the room or a random cat walking on the keyboard. You are equally welcome to work within our cozy-chic offices in Farringdon.

Some Of Our Upcoming Projects Include
 Upgrade our legacy services from Python 2 to Python 3 Implement new Data Ingestion Pipelines (Kubernetes) Design and implement a new Data Platform leveraging ELT patterns and Snowflake Ensuring that the company and systems are SOC-2 compliance We are in a pivotal phase and you will play an impactful role in vetting and setting up our new data ecosystem and infrastructure.
Data underpins the decisions we make as a business - and we need to have data we can rely on, and we need access to that data in a timely manner. But that data is also a precious commodity, entrusted to us by our customers. So we must keep it secure, accurate, and up to date. The DE Platform comprises the pipelines, technology and processes to help MOO achieve these goals.

We’re looking for someone who thrives in a team, even when that team is remote. Someone who takes and gives support to colleagues, and brings their perspective and experience to help the team make the best decisions. MOO creates the environment and conditions for success, and it’s as a team that we achieve that.

What’s it like to work at MOO? 

MOO’s the kind of workplace where you can really be yourself. Dye your hair purple. Hit the sofa with your laptop. Whatever helps you feel comfortable and happy at work. We want to help you grow in your career and set you up for success – while also recognising the importance of a healthy work/life balance.

That’s why we offer 25 days holiday rising by one day for each year here (for 5 years), a matched pension scheme, MOO’s share option scheme, and paid parental leave. We’ll offer you private healthcare, life insurance, a season ticket loan, subsidised gym membership and a cycle to work scheme. While most of us are currently working from home due to COVID-19 we can't wait to get back into the office where we like to treat our employees to breakfast and fresh fruit every day, lunch on Fridays and all the ice cream you can eat (just watch for the brain freeze).

Diversity Statement

We are working hard to create a representative, inclusive and super-friendly team, because we know that different experiences, perspectives and backgrounds make for a better workplace. And that creates a better experience for our customers. MOO doesn’t discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion or belief, gender, national origin, age, sexual orientation, marital status, disability or any other protected class.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits And Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company’s success.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up’s around.

Our savings accounts help diversify the high street and create new jobs, all while earning savers some of the highest interest on the market.But we go beyond finance, to empower our people, encourage professional growth and create an environment where everyone can thrive. We strive to create an inclusive and diverse workplace where people can be themselves and succeed.Our storyOakNorth Bank was built on the foundations of frustrations with old-school banking. In 2005, when our founders tried to get capital for their data analytics company, the computer said ‘no’. Unfortunately, all major banks in the UK were using the same computer – and it was broken.Why was it so difficult for a profitable business with impressive cashflow, retained clients, and clear commercial success to get a loan?The industry was backward-looking and too focused on historic financials, rather than future potential.So, what if there was a bank, founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs? One that offered a dramatically better borrowing experience for businesses?No more what ifs, OakNorth Bank exists.

Our diverse teams of experts combine innovative thinking and breakthrough use of technologies to progress further, faster. Our clients adapt and transform, and together we achieve enduring results.

PA. Bringing Ingenuity to Life.

Job Description

Become part of the team

Do you find yourself frustrated working with legacy technology or processes; constantly finding the need to innovate new and fit-for-purpose solutions? These are the problems our clients ask us to solve. You'll also need to be a pragmatist, to understand the design constraints of projects and get the job done.

As a lead cloud engineer you may operate solo, or within a team, where you and your teammates are responsible for successful delivery of the project release using an agile methodology. We put a lot of trust in you and your team to meet deadlines, and to find the rhythm and ways of working that suits our clients. You get ownership and control of the processes for taking your code into live.

Our teams have a mix of technology skills and work collaboratively, following DevOps (we emphasise the Dev in DevOps) and Test Automation practices. We also need you to contribute to developing the team, perhaps by sharing your expertise and experiences, or by mentoring teammates.

Your Accountability

As a Lead Engineer (Principal Consultant), you'll be leading a team or effort. We'll be looking at you to set direction and take responsibility for successfully achieving an outcome or deliverable. You may have a team of people to support, leading a development team, or else you could be working across multiple teams, providing some centralised expertise necessary for a larger program of work.

You'll have expertise in architecture and will feel comfortable leading higher level architectural discussions.Using your experience of the development process, it’s likely you’ll own the overall process across a team, or multiple teams, building strong principles and putting robust methods and patterns in place.You will be comfortable having conversations with the client regularly, being one of the main points of engagement between the client and the project.Coaching and mentoring the team will be important in the role.Your involvement in shaping bids (working with a bid team) will assist to create approaches or proposals, and perhaps you may also add valuable contributions during presentations to clients in a formal selection process.You'll play an active role in account management.

Qualifications

What we're looking for

Vortexa was founded to solve the immense information gap that exists in the energy industry. By using massive amounts of new satellite data and pioneering work in artificial intelligence, Vortexa creates an unprecedented view on the global flows of oil and fuels in real-time, bringing transparency and efficiency to the energy markets and society as a whole. 
The Challenge 
Processing thousands of rich data points per second from many vastly different external sources, moving terabytes of data while processing it in real-time, running complex prediction and forecasting AI models while coupling their output into a hybrid human-machine data refinement process and presenting the result through a nimble low-latency SaaS solution used by customers around the globe is no small feat of science and engineering. This processing requires models that can survive the scrutiny of industry experts, data analysts and traders, with the performance, stability, latency and agility a fast-moving startup influencing multi-$m transactions requires.

              Role - Data Engineer

Rate - £600/Day Inside IR35

Duration - 6 Months + Extensions

Location - Remote

Start - ASAP

Overview

I am working with an IT Consultancy who are delivering a large-scale Digital Transformation project for the insurance sector and are looking to secure a Data Engineer on a contract basis.

Any previous experience of working across the insurance industry would be preferred, but not essential.

There is more than a years worth of work to complete here, so this contract will almost certainly extend to see the project through to completion.

Requirements

The wider environment is being hosted in AWS and for this particular role we are looking for candidates experienced with Kimball Data Modelling - this is an essential requirement and will be a fundamental part of your day-to-day responsibilities.

Proven experience of ETL/Data Integration is also expected and any knowledge of working with Snowflake will be greatly beneficial.

As you will be representing the consultancy on this project and working with senior stakeholders on the client side, strong stakeholder management and solid communication skills are expected.

They want to move quickly with this one and can interview at short-notice, in order to get the right candidate secured and started on the project.

Overview

I am working with an IT Consultancy who are delivering a large-scale Digital Transformation project for the insurance sector and are looking to secure a Data Engineer on a contract basis.

Any previous experience of working across the insurance industry would be preferred, but not essential.

There is more than a years worth of work to complete here, so this contract will almost certainly extend to see the project through to completion.

Requirements

The wider environment is being hosted in AWS and for this particular role we are looking for candidates experienced with Kimball Data Modelling - this is an essential requirement and will be a fundamental part of your day-to-day responsibilities.

Proven experience of ETL/Data Integration is also expected and any knowledge of working with Snowflake will be greatly beneficial.

As you will be representing the consultancy on this project and working with senior stakeholders on the client side, strong stakeholder management and solid communication skills are expected.

They want to move quickly with this one and can interview at short-notice, in order to get the right candidate secured and started on the project.

Who are you?

We are looking for an Azure Data Engineer to join an exciting new team developing Insight solutions that will use analytics, AI and statistical processes to enhance our products capabilities and provide our healthcare clients with the right tools to continue to meet the rising patient need.

As a Data Engineer you will be a key member of the product team working on our transactional and analytics databases. You will be creating the scalable, efficient and testable production ready pipelines to move and transform the data, and you’ll be responsible for modelling the data objects, designing the structure of the new schemas and improving the performance of queries.

You will have a key role in our nascent data function as you work cross-functionally with business domain experts, engineers, product analysts and client delivery teams. You’ll understand data and reporting requirements from our BI and will ensure the teams have the information they need to make key decisions using data.

This opportunity will allow you to have a direct effect on what we do and how we do it. If you have a desire to learn and wish to accelerate your career, we can give you exposure to every facet of enterprise SaaS software and as much responsibility as you are ready to handle!

OK, that’s me, but who are you?

DrDoctor is a fast-growing digital health company founded in 2012. Our technology improves appointment scheduling, increases clinic efficiency by reducing no-shows and fills empty slots. We save the NHS millions of pounds each year and are currently deployed across 30 major hospitals around the UK including Guy’s and St Thomas’ & Great Ormond Street. With over 10 million patients active on the platform already, we’re on a journey to deliver the tools to radically transform the delivery of health services to make healthcare work for everyone – for patients, doctors, administrative teams and taxpayers.

Tell me more! Who will I be working with?

But Meet Shane

In this role you really will interact with every part of the business on a daily basis, even as we grow.

'I'm Shane, and I work in the Data team within the Product group. This team is relatively new, and we manage the usual tasks around unlocking insights from various data sources. Our mission is a little different though. It's not financial figures or social media data we're crunching. This data is used to help our wonderful NHS give patients the care they need quickly and efficiently. There aren't many data jobs where you can make an important contribution to the community like this. It's a good feeling.

Also, much of what's on our future roadmaps is greenfield. That's pretty exciting. It means we need ambitious people with open minds, big imaginations and bags of drive. People who are willing to explore and learn and can collaborate and share their knowledge on projects not just with developers but people right across the DrDoctor team.

This is a company with big plans and one that is tangibly scaling-up. Pre-Covid the headcount here was under 40. That number has easily doubled since (and that includes yours truly). Our challenge is to ensure everything we build is secure, flexible and scalable, and can keep pace with a flourishing company.

Plus we're a friendly and sociable bunch of people who come from all around the world and all walks of life. And we like a laugh.'

OK, I’m interested. What experience do I need to have?

We’d like you to have some experience of
Data orchestration tools moving production scale data – we use Azure Data Factory but if you’ve used something else then we’d still love to hear from you! SQL Server Platform T-SQL Development Data Warehouses CI/CD for data pipelines (for example Azure DevOps) 
Bonus points for
Infrastructure as code (for example ARM templates, Terraform, Bicep) Data and network security Python / Databricks Power BI Machine learning services Kimball methodology NoSQL databases Health tech experience
I can’t wait to get started, what are the perks?

An awesome team? Ok, you want more?
Remote by default approach - everyone at DrDoctor will work remotely, most or all of the time with regular opportunities to socialise and engage.Flexible working (work where you are at your best and at times when you feel most productive)25 days holiday plus Bank Holidays (with our own DrDoctor Bank Holidays thrown in for good measure!)Personal development time every other FridayMental health support through our partner OpenUpSalary competitive and dependant on experienceEMI share options schemeDiscretionary bonusDrinks/other fun things sent to you in the postYoga on a Monday, team sports and other fitness classes adhoc
And when we're not in the midst of a pandemic, we also do lunch and beer every other Friday, company wide ski trips, summer and Christmas parties and regular company/team socials!

We are currently recruiting heavily and have a lot of CV’s to go through. However, we don’t wait for roles to close before going through your CV. We will be in touch in a few days to let you know if we think we might be a match, and if we are not. Unfortunately, because we get so many CV’s we are not able to send an individual response if it’s not a match. However, if you want more details as to why, just drop us a note and we will arrange to get some feedback over to you.

If it’s a match, then we will arrange a time to talk to you on a quick 30 minute call. It’s just an informal chat so you can relax! We will tell you more about the role, the team and why you should want to join us.

If we continue then we will invite you in to meet the team and founders. Depending on your role we may also ask you to complete an assessment.

We get there are a lot of great roles out there, so we will make sure to get through the rounds as quickly as possible. All we ask is you keep us up to date with your plans.

Salary banding for this role is £50,000 - £74,000

We strive to create an inclusive and diverse workplace where people can be themselves and succeed.Our storyOakNorth Bank was built on the foundations of frustrations with old-school banking. In 2005, when our founders tried to get capital for their data analytics company, the computer said ‘no’. Unfortunately, all major banks in the UK were using the same computer – and it was broken.Why was it so difficult for a profitable business with impressive cashflow, retained clients, and clear commercial success to get a loan?The industry was backward-looking and too focused on historic financials, rather than future potential.So, what if there was a bank, founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs? One that offered a dramatically better borrowing experience for businesses?No more what ifs, OakNorth Bank exists.

About Us

Description

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder

              Hi we’re Tempo, we’re a team of 50 on a mission to enable everyone to fulfil their potential through work, and to be the place where amazing careers and companies are built.

Since launching in 2017 we've become the go-to business and commercial hiring platform for fast growing companies, and our clients include a whopping 15 unicorns! We've also raised £8m from some great investors including Adecco Group and Hambro Perks. We’re doubling our team by 2023 and now have international expansion in our sights.

When Ben and Ollie started Tempo they were amazed that such an important process, that affects everyone, worked so badly.

If you’re a company, hiring is the most important thing you do. Your people are your business and who you hire can be the difference between failure and success. As individuals we spend 70% of our time at work, so it’s a big deal where we choose to go. Despite this there is huge unhappiness with the solutions we rely on to help. They are slow, expensive and at their worst, totally demoralising.

It's why we're here - to build a platform that delivers the hiring experience people deserve. Fast, transparent and human.

We're also now exploring products to help candidates navigate their career longer term so they can be hired based on their potential, not just their past experience.

We live our mission when we hire, looking to make the experience human and enjoyable whatever the outcome. We offer an exciting environment to build a career, with employees achieving promotions on average 9.5 months after probation. Read more on Glassdoor.

You will be primarily focused on building the data pipeline, data lake, and tooling that our Data Scientists and Analysts use every day to support business stakeholders with all insights which will help define and drive future strategies for Tempo.

Long term, there’s great potential to continue to be responsible for this space at a more senior level, or to work towards other roles within our data team. The future looks exciting for us as we plan on further fundraising and expansion - in the UK and potentially internationally. We’re looking for someone excited to be part of that journey and to grow and develop themselves, in line with our growth plans.

Requirements

About Us

The Oakland Group is a fast growing, modern consulting company who operate at the intersection of people, process and technology. As Data specialists, we work across the full data ecosystem including: Strategy & Governance, Architecture, Engineering and Advanced Analytics.

We're on a mission to create the best data consultancy in the UK, where our brilliant people can create the ingenious solutions that are powering our growth.

Founded in 1986 out of our Leeds HQ, we work a wonderful range of clients ranging from FTSE 100 Telcos to Series-A funded start-ups, regularly punching above our weight due to our obsession with quality and client satisfaction.

Oakland has been named one of the Top Small Businesses and Top Consultancies to work for in the UK. We're committed to ensuring our employees are given opportunities to grow both personally and professionally and are rewarded for their incredible work.

Our obsession with quality and client satisfaction had led to rapid growth in the last year and we work with some of the UK's biggest and best-known brands along with a number of newer tech disrupters.

Due to exponential growth over the past 18 months, we have a number of opportunities across each of our talented and passionate teams. We're still small enough for everyone's voice to be heard whilst working with some of the worlds most recognised brands.

What does it mean to be an Engineer at Oakland? 

We're problem solvers. At Oakland, our engineers work with a range of clients, to help them solve complex operational problems with innovative data solutions.

We're proudly tech agnostic. Our clients come to us with a range of challenges, non-two of which are the same. This means as an Oakland Engineer you'll need to be adaptable, and in return you'll gain exposure to a wide variety of tech stacks across Azure, AWS and GCP.

We're collaborative. Our teams are made up of T-shaped individuals who are either fantastic generalists or specialists in one or more area across the full engineering stack: Databases & Storage, DevOps & Cloud, Analytics & Data Science, Data Processing (ETL/Pipelines), Coding, Architecture. No one knows everything so we challenge our teams to share knowledge and ideas.

We're always learning. As consultants, our clients look to us as experts, so we push our Engineering teams to be the best they can be through annual time allocated L&D plans, funded by Oakland throughout your career.

The role

As a Data Engineer at Oakland, you'll play a vital role in the delivery, planning and management of projects across up to two of our brilliant clients.

As a Engineer, you'll have gained some experience across most elements of the Engineering stack, including databases, front & back-end, DevOps, Pipelines and Analytics (although we also really value specialists). You'll begin to contribute not only to delivery, but also begin to pick up aspects of technical leadership of projects, becoming more client facing and contributing to project planning and delivery management.

Your role as a mid will also include more internal responsibilities, such as mentoring Junior Engineers, assisting with hiring and also contributing to technical blogs and articles.

Your work will involve working on both greenfield and brownfield projects and an ability to use modern tools to solve old legacy problems.

The person

As we specialise in data and analytics, we are looking for developers who are excited by the ability to work across different problems, projects and clients and who genuinely cares about the end to end data space (including engineering, science, quality, analytics and BI).

You'll be a programmer at heart with a passion for code as well as an understanding of application architectures.

The technology we use varies between clients so although we value specialists, we encourage our engineers to become technology polyglots and provide training and mentoring to support with this. This means an appetite to learn is a must!

              Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?

We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant engineers, designers, and data scientists who want to help define a low carbon future.

Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. We were part of the Y Combinator Summer 2020 batch and have secured backing from the UK government's innovation arm, InnovateUK, the NatWest accelerator and the London Business School Incubator.

To join Carbon Chain, you'll be a keen technologist who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of 10 passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.

What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?

As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Engineer is to work with our Data Scientists to organize, automate, and deploy the data pipelines we need to provide that understanding.

We're a small team of versatile technologists and we don't believe in a siloed approach. Our data engineers sit side by side with software engineers and designers, making sure that we have the data we need to provide the experience our customers want. You'll be deeply embedded in the product team, with your work being deployed to clients every week. You'll work closely with our domain experts, and have the chance to present to clients if that's something that excites you.

You can expect to have:
Ownership of your projectsAn independent path to productionThe ability to make real changes with tangible business value

Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. Our ETL is run in Dagster, which is a friendlier and more modern version of Airflow. You'd be joining an experienced team but you'd be the first data engineer, so you'd have lots of scope to define best practices and choose your tools.

We're interested in talking to people with DevOps and classical software engineering experience, as well as those coming from Data Science who have a passion for scaling ETL systems.

Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology, the ability to build close relationships with your team, and the right to work in the UK.

Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyondAutomation with Dagster and Github ActionsDeployment via GCPContainerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).

You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.

What we require from applicants
Right to work in the UK and willingness to come to London office 2+ days a week1+ years of commercial Data Engeering, Data Science, or Software Engineering experienceA passion for environmental issuesA demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with scientists and engineersThe grit and energy to work in an early stage startup

What we're offering
Competitive salary + generous equity packageFlexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeingFlexible working location (we like to meet in the office couple of times every week)£1000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new thingsTech equipment of your choiceTeam lunch on Wednesdays, and frequent pub tripsPakt coffee and snacks of your choice in the office28 days holiday + bank holidays 

We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.

If you think your skills and experience match what we're looking for and you'd like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch!

You'll have expertise in architecture and will feel comfortable leading higher level architectural discussions.Using your experience of the development process, it’s likely you’ll own the overall process across a team, or multiple teams, building strong principles and putting robust methods and patterns in place.You will be comfortable having conversations with the client regularly, being one of the main points of engagement between the client and the project.Coaching and mentoring the team will be important in the role.Your involvement in shaping bids (working with a bid team) will assist to create approaches or proposals, and perhaps you may also add valuable contributions during presentations to clients in a formal selection process.You'll play an active role in account management.

Qualifications

What we're looking for

PA is a Google Cloud Premier Partner and we create innovative solutions using the whole spectrum of Google Cloud products and services, as well as other leading cloud platforms and technologies.

You probably have experience as a software or DevOps engineer using languages and tools such as Java, Python, Kubernetes and Terraform, but it's your understanding of and enthusiasm for cloud technologies, technologies and techniques that are most important.

Ideally you will be qualified to Google Certified Data Engineer, Certified Cloud Architect or Cloud Developer level, although good hands-on experience is just as valued.

You probably have experience in building and delivering solutions on Google Cloud, perhaps using serverless products such as App Engine and Cloud Functions, or containers deployed to GKE. Or maybe you have focused on building data pipelines using Dataflow and Apache Beam.

Hiscox is seeking a strong and dynamic “hands on” Lead Data Engineer to join our Re & ILS Technology Team. You will help us to create a professional data engineering practice, architecting and building a greenfield cloud based data analytics platform to support our new data strategy.

We are looking for an enthusiastic and self-motivated individual with a thirst for cloud agnostic tech, data processing/analytics, machine learning and good data governance knowhow to help grow and lead the overall team in this area.

The successful candidate will help architect and build new data solutions and initial PoCs using SaaS and PaaS-based services on Azure.

The ability to critique and assess whole-of-industry options (both functionally and non-functionally) and communicate options is imperative.

Our role requires someone with a strong understanding of how to set up the appropriate tools and technologies in the cloud to securely process big and small, unstructured and structured data – from ingestion, cleansing, transformation, enrichment, outlier/anomaly detection, auto matching/classification and finally to the delivery of accurate data for insights, analysis and reporting.

Knowing how to deploy fast R&D solutions and robust operational/production systems is key and having previous experience of implementing secure, scalable and automated data pipelines and self-service business intelligence solutions is a must.

As Lead Data Engineer your role carries the responsibility and ownership of making technology choices and influencing the overall design and direction of Re & ILS’s digital transformation in relation to the way it processes and utilises its various data assets. In return we will ensure you can fully self-organise, have autonomy and flexibility in your decision making.

You will have a number of years’ experience in Data engineering and prior experience growing and leading a team of data engineering experts.

The role is ideally suited to someone interested in working with the latest cloud technologies in a dynamic environment, in the face of high performance, complex data wrangling and high variety of data asset challenges.

At Hiscox we care about our people. We hire the best people for the job and we’re committed to diversity and creating a truly inclusive culture, which we believe drives success.

We have also learned over the past 2 years that working life doesn’t always have to be in the office, and now it is safe to do so we have introduced hybrid working to encourage a healthy work life balance.

This hybrid working model is set by the team rather than the business to enable you to manage your own personal work-life balance.

We see it as the best of both worlds; structure and sociability on one hand, and independence and flexibility on the other.

We look forwards to working with you.

The Role 
We are more than a support team. We enable the rapid but sustainable growth of Personio and ensure the financial health and legal stability of the organization. If you want to work and learn in an interdisciplinary team of Finance, Legal, and Business Intelligence and want to make a difference from day one, the BIFL team is the right place for you.
As a Teamlead Data Engineering at Personio, you will have a crucial role at one of the fastest-growing B2B SaaS companies in Europe. In an emerging team, you will build up and extend a data platform, which ensures that we have the best environment to make fast data-driven decisions.
Therefore, we are aiming for a standardized multi-interface data platform that can enable self-service delivery and end-to-end solutions for all data and BI-related use cases at Personio.
With your experience, you will develop a short- and long-term strategy with the team to reach this goal in an iterative way. The overarching architectural paradigm we follow is the Data Mesh as we believe that at the scale Personio is at right now, we can best serve other teams by setting guardrails for interaction with the data platform as well as codifying best practices for ingesting, processing, and querying data. Another important aspect is to enable teams to take end-to-end ownership of their data processing, as the organization has to remain agile, and that extends to the use of data for reporting purposes and for building data products. Concretely, the agility is ensured by us stepping out of the way as much as possible when it comes to the usage and integration of data and instead building a toolset for easy interaction with the data platform on the different layers (ingestion, processing, querying of data). This also includes tools for quality monitoring and making the data accessible via different means, depending on the evolving needs of the organization (e.g. SQL layer, APIs). 
Building such a toolset requires empathy for the users as we constantly need to step into their shoes to adequately bridge the gap between their expertise and the data engineering tasks so that they can concentrate on generating business value. It also requires frequent communication with our internal stakeholders to ensure the solution can be evolved continuously and reflects changing requirements over time. To this end, you will get to talk to both technical and non-technical groups of people. Apart from that, you are also willing to organize and develop your team, act as a role model and respected sparring partner and share your knowledge within relevant groups.
Your tasks and responsibilities will include:
Build, improve and extend a scalable and cloud-based data platform as a service in an iterative way, based on the requirements of our stakeholders and on strategic decisions which you drive with our teamIdentify and provide tools and advice for data ingestion, processing, and analysis and empower other domains in gaining valuable Insights through themBe a proactive member of our data circle in order to drive knowledge exchange across the company and moderate on data engineering topicsDefine and align on interfaces and processes across the organization to make sure that we are working in a scalable environment with high data quality and reliability

What you need to succeed 
Experience in leading, developing, and hiring highly qualified data engineers, and organizing them in an optimal team structureExperience in ensuring long term strategic value of engineering solutions and in enabling other teams to make use of themExperience in being a proactive member in federated data groups in order to create an environment where each domain can act independently while ensuring interoperability between themStrong communication skills: Ability to discuss ideas and requirements with stakeholders from different departments and to transport our strategic visionStrong professional work experience within big data environment and in the cloud (e.g. Hadoop, EMR, AWS, Azure,) as well as with Python, Java or ScalaDeep understanding of approaches to data storage and different data architectures (RDMBS, NOSQL databases, OLAP) for driving the evolution of our infrastructureProficiency with SQLPractice in clean code and test-driven developmentKnowledgeable about cloud infrastructure automation and management (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Gitlab CI, CDK, Terraform)Living agile: Frequent development cycles, continuous delivery and DevOpsLogical and analytical thinking in combination with a high degree of data qualityFluency in English (Level C1/C2)Strong desire to learn about new trends and technologies

ROLE CAN BE BASED FROM UK, GERMANY OR SPAIN**

We are IMMO. Here to revolutionize the real estate industry, for consumers and investors alike.

Residential real estate is the biggest asset class in the world and the market in Europe is worth an estimated $50 trillion. It’s a huge untapped market, but it’s also completely fragmented!

Homeowners wrestle with huge fees and uncertain processes when they want to sell. Renters struggle to find high-quality homes and often deal with unsympathetic landlords. Financial institutions can’t invest large pools of money into the sector without hiring an army of disparate third parties. And to complicate matters further, building new homes churns out gigatons of carbon, all whilst we face a housing crisis and a global climate emergency.

IMMO is Europe's first technology powered residential real estate platform, designed to create portfolios of existing single family rental (SFR) housing. Our proprietary technology allows us to unlock investment access to 98% of the residential market currently being overlooked, at scale and speed. At the same time, we offer better solutions to consumers – empowering homeowners with quick and transparent sales, and providing a next-gen renting experience for our residents to enjoy living in beautiful homes. With technology in our DNA, data is at the heart of decision making, and we do things sustainably by up-cycling existing properties that are responsibly retrofitted.

IMMO recently raised $75 million in what remains one of Europe’s largest Series B funding rounds. Among our investors are some of the world’s top venture capital firms. IMMO has been awarded “Tech Pioneer” by the World Economic Forum and has been titled “Real estate asset manager of the future” by Goldman Sachs.

We are 120+ strong with experienced professionals working across our integrated residential ‘value chain’: sourcing and acquisitions, refurbishment, lettings, property management and portfolio management. Our team includes successful entrepreneurs and industry leaders from McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, Blackstone, Uber, Amazon, Morgan Stanley, Google and many others – and we are growing, fast. With a strong track record in some of the toughest European resi markets, we’re now eyeing expansion across the continent, building up our presence in Germany, Spain and the UK.

We’re straightforward, open-minded, creative and not afraid to challenge the status quo. And we’re looking for talented IMMOrtals to join us in our mission to truly change the way consumers and investors access residential real estate. If this sounds like you… read on!

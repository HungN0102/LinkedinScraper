At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Apollo, or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. 
As a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties. 
SWE principles include: 
 
 Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems. Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team. 
Technologies We Use 
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use: 
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github 
What We Value 
Engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience coding in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Ability to communicate and collaborate with a variety of individuals, including engineers, users and non-technical team members. 
Willingness to learn and make decisions independently, and the ability to ask questions when stuck.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. 
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. 
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points. 
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use: 
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github 
Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them. 
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data. 
Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial but not necessary. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

At Palantir, we're passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use their data. Our technology has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir's platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you'll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You'll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world's most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you'll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
Our Principles
 Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

In-person work.  We believe that in person work is better for the kind of fast-paced, creative problem solving that is involved in kickstarting something huge. We work 3-4 days a week in the office in King's Cross, London. 
Don't waste your time: work on a product that customers actually love.  We can't get enough of the feeling when our customers tell us we helped them win a huge deal. Come join us 
Normally we'll start with a video call. We like to do a simple technical exercise on the phone on either the first or second call. If that goes well, we'll invite you to spend half a day with us working on problems together and getting to know each other a lot more.

It’s a great place to work. 
 
There are currently over 500,000 active Simply Business insurance policies in the UK alone. And we have offices in London, Northampton and Boston, USA. Talking of offices, ours are bright, airy and geared up for really smart working. We’re flexible, with plenty of remote workers coming in and out, and we believe work and life should be hand in hand, rather than a juggling act. So no need to worry about school pick-ups, or a horrible commute. 
Our people are our most important asset, so we focus on building a working life that helps us thrive, not stick. We're proud of our inclusive and supportive culture, and we're passionate about creating an environment where everyone's cultural backgrounds, skills, and perspectives are valued. Join us and you’ll be part of our journey to creating something even better, for our customers and ourselves.
 
 As a Software Engineer you’ll: 
Develop customer-focused products in a culture that champions Agile, cross functional teams and continuous collaboration
 
 Responsibilities include: 
Being hands-on in developing our products using best practices, appropriate tools and technologies 
Working with cross functional collaborative teams, helping to clarify requirements at the onset of projects and suggesting different and relevant technical approaches 
Championing Agile processes whilst creating amazingly useful systems in a collaborative way for our customers 
Highlighting areas for continuous improvement and driving their prioritisation 
Being proactive in suggesting new tools, technologies and ways of working
 
 What we’re looking for: 
Strong programming skills in any language. We look for strong Engineers and our philosophy is that a strong Engineer is not defined by the technologies they use; therefore Ruby experience is not essential. You’ll just need to be happy to cross-over to Ruby if you join us – and we will support you with that 
The ability to communicate complex technical concepts to both tech and non-tech colleagues 
Understanding and appreciation of Agile methodologies 
Strong desire to work collaboratively with business teams. We do not divide ‘business’ and tech’ teams, we see both as one team as we are all working towards one shared goal 
Strong interpersonal skills to work well in our very open and friendly environment 
Pro-active in suggesting new tools, processes and technologies – anything which will help us continually improve!

From new products, media campaigns, names, logos, packaging or flavours, Zappi allows companies to shelve bad ideas and improve on good ones. We bring together top expertise in applied statistics, data science, visualization, UX and engineering to create a platform that allows non-expert users to make high-stakes decisions easily and confidently. We believe it’s possible to run a profitable business while also having a positive impact on the environment and our communities 
 
What we value 
We believe in hiring people that want a chance to do their best work. We believe driven engineers operate best in high-trust, small, cross-functional teams who work together with the rest of the business to bring value to our customers. 
We believe great engineering happens in great teams that value improvement, curiosity and continuous learning. We align as a business on the challenges we need to solve and trust teams solve them in the best possible way. 
We value experimentation, failing fast and being bold. We practice continuous delivery and fast iteration. We hate politics, gate-keeping, unfairness and toxic behaviour. We believe in transparency, even when it’s unflattering. We believe in honesty, even when it’s uncomfortable. We treat failure as a learning opportunity. We believe in ethical and responsible business practices and having a positive impact on the environment and our communities. 
 
What you will be working on 
Our Rollout team has the mission to optimize the processes that allow Zappi to scale its research solutions across different customer verticals and give these solutions a global reach. In order to achieve this, the team works in close partnership with our internal operational teams to get a deep understanding of their processes, identifying opportunities for automation and simplification.
 The team consists of JavaScript and Ruby developers working with React talking to Rails API services via GraphQL and REST. You will work closely with other engineering teams, building a system which integrates with various internal and external services. You will work in an engineering function that practices continuous integration and deploys to production multiple times per day on an autoscaling Kubernetes cluster running on AWS. 
 
Requirements 
You will need to be able to demonstrate characteristics of a intermediate engineer (this is generally more than 2 years experience) 
You are able to demonstrate how you add value to a team as a intermediate engineer, and what you expect from a high performing team 
You have transferable technical experience. We don’t need deep expertise in our tech stack if you can demonstrate your ability to learn new technologies 
You have the right to work in the location advertised or in any of our supported remote working countries
 
 Equal Opportunity 
Zappi is an equal opportunity employer; our diversity is a major strength. We maintain a constant dialogue with our teams and wider communities about how we can become a more inclusive place to work. 
Unlimited holidays – we want well rested and motivated teams so encourage people to take plenty of time off. We don’t cap your allowance, but do set a minimum of at least 20 days per year plus national holidays. 
Private medical healthcare cover 
Group risk, life & disability contributions 
Flexible working arrangements, including remote (unless otherwise specified) 
Thoughtfully designed offices to support both individual work and collaboration without interrupting others 
Generous hardware budget – get what works for you 
Support setting up your home office, if appropriate (chair + desk, etc.) 
Wellbeing benefits such as free yoga and access to trained therapists / counsellors 
Tailored personal development through training allowances, coaching, mentorship and career frameworks 
We understand that you may be involved in many interview processes, so we don’t expect our candidates to complete any take home exercises. If you apply for this role, you can expect the following: 
HR screening call  - A short 15 minute call with our hiring manager to check how suitable you are for the role and cover any administrative points. 
Technical Interview  - This will usually last 2-2.5 hours and will take place with a small group of our engineers. This includes some quiet time to work though some exercises, then time to dive into your answers. We are not looking for perfect answers to all questions, what matters is your thought process and how you came to the answers. Expect to get stuck into in-depth technical discussions. There will also be time to learn about how we work, and what you will be working on. 
Cultural Interview  - This is a 1 hour informal session, usually spent with your future team. This is a chance for you to learn more about what it's like working for Zappi and to hear more about what you will be working on. If you are based near one of our offices, we offer the option to come into the office for these so you can get a real feel for your working life with us!

 Engineering track 
Developing sophisticated software to better the world. The software engineer's role is to engineer the delivery of working software that meets our client's needs. 
Sounds fancy, right? As a Software Engineer at Entelect you are responsible for more than just writing code. You will find that the process, environment, tooling and even maturity of the client’s software knowledge varies across the teams, so the Software Engineer’s job would vary too, depending on the situation. Being adaptable as a Software Engineer is very important. You will find that as you transition through different projects, teams, domains and clients, you will always be learning - and that’s part of what makes working at Entelect cool. 
 
About the role 
If you are at this point in your career, it means that you have experience, you are working fairly independently and are probably becoming everyone's ‘go-to guy’. As an Intermediate you are expected to be skilled enough that you can assist other Software Engineers. You have a good sense of things like coding principles, stakeholder engagement and you are a damn good trouble-shooter because you understand how systems fit together, and when and who to ask for help. At this point in your career, you should also be able to architect basic components of a system. 
 
Our UK business is just getting started, so you'll have an opportunity to shape our identity as we grow. We have big ambitions and the support from our hugely successful South African business. 
Our UK package includes: 
Hybrid work arrangement 
Pension scheme with company contribution 
Life assurance and income protection 
Generous leave allowance 
Furthermore, you get to experience Entelect culture and all it has to offer: 
Professional and personal growth 
Training, mentorship and exposure to lots of different opportunities to experiment and learn. 
 
Project variety 
With a variety of projects using an array of technologies across various business domains, you can find work that suits you. 
 
Team-based projects 
All our projects are team-based, so you're always with other experienced people who will show you best practices and involve you in finding new and innovative ways to do things. 
 
Work with like-minded people 
Fellowship is forged with people who care about you, their craft and the hobbies you share. 
 
Tech company run by tech people 
We’re an ambitious, growing organisation without the usual nonsense and politics. 
 
Autonomy and identity 
We function as a tribe of tribes, so there’s plenty of autonomy and scope to create a different identity for each project and team. 
 
Global reach 
We’ve grown into 3 continents and we’re always looking for awesome devs, analysts, UX gurus, data engineers and scientists, architects, leaders, and more.

Softwire are looking for motivated apprentices to join their team of software developers. As an apprentice at Softwire, you’ll get a thorough introduction to commercial software development, on a fantastic package with a salary of £24,000, plus bonus and other benefits. 
Tell me more… 
Softwire's two-year apprenticeship starts with three months of full-time training, leading into commercial software development work on Softwire’s customer project teams. 
You will get to work on a variety of projects, with a range of technologies, and they'll provide ongoing training and support every step of the way. Apprentices graduate with a Level-4 BCS-accredited Diploma in Software Engineering, and an internationally recognised coding qualification. 
Do I fit the bill? ️ 
Who can apply:
 Anyone with no degree or with a non-STEM degree.

The people they’re looking for: 
A passion for solving real-world challenges : First and foremost, you’ll get a buzz from building things that make a difference to businesses, people and society. They also want to see a passion for coding – any experience you have is a bonus 
An articulate people-person : You’ll be interacting with a wide variety of individuals: some deeply techy, some from complex business domains, and others with low digital literacy. You’ll need to become comfortable understanding their needs and discussing potentially complicated technical ideas with all of them 
A positive, can-do team player : You love pushing the team to greater heights by helping colleagues out wherever you can. You always look to improve yourself and others. Your default answer to a question is ‘yes’, and you make big problems seem small 
The exciting bits! 
Starting salary of £24,000 plus annual bonus 
25 days annual holiday with the option to buy or sell, plus charity days 
Consistently one of the best places to work in the UK (They’ve been in the Best Companies to Work For listing, 10 years in a row)

Equality, Diversity and Inclusion at Softwire ️ 
""Of course, there’s more to Softwire than building software. We’re working hard to nurture a diverse, inclusive and supportive culture, where people love what they do and feel inspired by working with some of the best minds in the business."" 
What’s the culture like? 
""We also have a generous budget for a varied programme of staff events and activities, with employees, not management, deciding how the money is spent. 
Put all of this together, and you see why we’ve got such high retention rates, and why we’ve been among the Best Companies to Work For list, 10 years in a row."" 
These are the values on which the Softwire company culture is based; 
We really care about what we do:
 Individually and collectively, we really care about doing a good job. We sweat every detail but never forget the big picture. We are always trying to improve what we do and how we do it. When we notice something could be better, we do something about it. 
We trust and are trustworthy:
 Sharing information and telling people how and why decisions are made. Doing the right thing even when no one is watching. 
Not bothering with lots of rules and processes that we don’t need. No politics, gossip or cliques: we’re all on the same team, even if we disagree sometimes. 
We are kind:
 Showing appreciation and gratitude towards others. Saying thank you. Seeking to understand someone else’s point of view, rather than just focusing on pushing your own. Showing consideration and understanding. Helping out if someone is struggling."" 
We are fun 
Work won’t always be fun but everyone should feel enthusiastic about working at Softwire. We want everyone to enjoy the time they spend at work and we want clients to enjoy the time spent with us. We value taking the time to get to know each other and make friends. 
So, what are the next steps? ✏️ 
Softwire's Application Process :  ""We know how much effort you put into your application, so we always aim to get back to you within two working days at each stage. And if you get to the interviews, you can choose your own timeslots, using our online booking system. Given the current situation, we’ll be running this year’s recruitment process entirely remotely."" 
Online aptitude & coding tests  (2-3 hours): Complete a series of exercises to demonstrate your capabilities 
Introductory interview : This non-technical interview helps us get to know each other and understand what inspires you 
Second interview  (2-3 hours): We then spend some time on a deep dive, to get a feel for the way you solve business and technology challenges

 More about Softwire: What you’ll be part of 
 
Our mission is to solve our customers’ business challenges using technology. This often demands creativity, tackling complex issues in intelligent ways, to help organisations streamline operations and better serve their customers and users. 
 
We played an important role in the Moorfields Eye Hospital/DeepMind collaboration, which demonstrated how artificial intelligence could help doctors fast-track patients with serious eye diseases. We built the system that runs the BBC Live Events websites, sharing content from Glastonbury, the Reading and Leeds festivals, and the BBC Proms. We’ve been the long-term digital partner for David Lloyd Leisure, building its mobile app, booking system and numerous other capabilities. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Find out what else we’ve been involved with. 
 
Of course, there’s more to Softwire than building software. We’re working hard to nurture a diverse, inclusive and supportive culture, where people love what they do and feel inspired by working with some of the best minds in the business. We also have a generous budget for a varied programme of staff events and activities, with employees, not management, deciding how the money is spent. 
 
Put all of this together, and you see why we’ve got such high retention rates, and why we’ve been among the best small-to-medium-sized companies in the Best Companies to Work For list, 10 years in a row.

About the Role: 
Our Software Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients. 
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few. 
Software Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them. 
Who We Are Looking For: 
 You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. 
You are a broadly skilled engineer, interested in developing web services and building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers. 
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making. 
You work with confidence and without ego. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. 
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. 
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

 More about Softwire: What you’ll be part of 
 
Our mission is to solve our customers’ business challenges using technology. This often demands creativity, tackling complex issues in intelligent ways, to help organisations streamline operations and ultimately better serve their customers and users. 
 
We played an important role in the Moorfields Eye Hospital/DeepMind collaboration, which demonstrated how artificial intelligence could help doctors fast-track patients with serious eye diseases. We built the system that runs the BBC Live Events websites, sharing content from Glastonbury, the Reading and Leeds festivals, and the BBC Proms. We’ve been the long-term digital partner for David Lloyd Leisure, building its mobile app, booking system and numerous other capabilities. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Find out what else we’ve been involved with. 
 
Of course, there’s more to Softwire than building software. We’re working hard to nurture a diverse, inclusive and supportive culture, where people love what they do and feel inspired by working with some of the best minds in the business. We also have a generous budget for a varied programme of staff events and activities, with employees, not management, deciding how the money is spent.

You’ll get a grounding in coding, source control, modern technology stacks, and more.

We built the system that runs the BBC Live Events websites, sharing content from Glastonbury, the Reading and Leeds festivals, and the BBC Proms.

We’re working hard to nurture a diverse, inclusive and supportive culture, where people love what they do and feel inspired by working with some of the best minds in the business.

Please speak to your recruiter about the working pattern that works best for you.

A hugely diverse range of clients rely on us to deliver the kind of change that adds genuine, lasting value to their business. 
Personal independence 
Regulation and controls are standard practice in our industry and Deloitte is no exception. These controls provide important legal protection for both you and the firm. We are subject to a number of audit regulations, one of which requires that certain colleagues abide by specific personal independence constraints. This can mean that you and your ""Immediate Family Members"" are not permitted to hold certain financial interests (shares, funds, bonds etc.) with audit clients of the firm. The recruitment team will provide further detail as you progress through the recruitment process. 
About Deloitte 
Our Purpose & Strategy 
To make an impact that matters for our clients, our people and society - defines who we are and what we stand for. Our purpose provides the foundation for our strategy and our aspiration to be the undisputed leader in professional services: this is not about size, it's about being the first choice. The first choice for the largest and most influential clients, and the first choice for the best talent.
 What do we do? 
Deloitte offers global integrated professional services that include Audit & Assurance, Consulting, Financial Advisory, Legal, Risk Advisory and Tax Consulting. Our approach combines intellectual leadership, industrial expertise, insight, consulting & problem solving capabilities whatever the role, technology revolutions and innovation from multiple disciplines to help our clients excel anywhere in the world.

Being part of Deloitte NSE supports our aspiration to be the undisputed leader in professional services and will create more opportunity and growth for our people. 
What do we value? 
What brings us all together at Deloitte? It’s how we approach the thousands of decisions we make every day. How we behave, our beliefs and our attitudes. In other words: our values. Whatever we do, wherever we are in the world, we lead the way, serve with integrity, take care of each other, foster inclusion, and collaborate for maximum impact. These five shared values lead every decision we make and action we take, guiding us to deliver impact how and where it matters most.
 Being a Leader at Deloitte 
Cultural fit and purpose-led leadership is crucial for Deloitte. Our leaders always set the example and inspire their colleagues. They make quality time for people and take an interest in them. They know what matters to people - both inside and outside work – and value them as individuals; always finding opportunities to develop them while showing respect and appreciation. 
We expect colleagues at all levels to embrace and live our purpose and our leadership culture by challenging themselves to identify issues that are most important for our clients, our people, and for society and make an impact that matters. We know leadership comes in all shapes and sizes, but our Leadership Charter helps all of our people understand what we’re looking for: 
We live our purpose:  we act as a role model, embracing and living our purpose and values, and recognizing others for the impact they make 
We develop talent:  we develop high-performing people and teams through challenging and meaningful opportunities 
We drive performance:  we deliver exceptional client service; maximize results and drive high performance from people while fostering collaboration across businesses and borders 
We believe positive influence can make an impact that matters:  we influence clients, teams, and individuals positively, leading by example and establishing confident relationships with increasingly senior people 
We move, together, towards a strategic direction:  we understand key objectives for clients and Deloitte, aligning people to objectives and setting priorities and direction.

On top of this, we use an in-house batch scheduler to execute jobs that run programs written in a proprietary functional relational language, which essentially power all our data analytics tools. Due to the complex nature of our batches, the scheduler contains many advanced features that have a lot in common with state-of-the-art orchestration engines (e.g. Ansible), and is one of our most widely used internal product: engineers and quant developers use it to analyze in depth the behavior of their scripts, and client-facing teams employ it to set up and monitor production batches. 
The scheduling software, currently in its second iteration, is made of a single mission control node and multiple agents installed on each machine in our cloud environment and would highly benefit from a series of improvements in terms of usability, batch structure, data normalization and introduction of new helpful features. Your role will be to design and develop a maintainable, robust and fail-safe system based on a modular and configurable job structure. 
 
About the role: 
This role will: 
Include intuitive monitoring and scheduling interfaces 
Provide efficient ways for both engineers and non-technical users to interact with the scheduler 
Support core and advanced features such as: variable overrides, task loops, conditional execution, privileges and permissions, intelligent error-handling 
This will involve exposure to the full development stack as you will need to understand business and technical requirements and translate them into deliverables, working with both backend and frontend components; you will also be responsible for writing automated tests and proper documentation. 
You do not need to be an expert in all aspects mentioned above, but it is essential that you have a strong desire to constantly learn, and to develop and own a critical software project upon which production systems will depend: we think this will be very interesting for someone passionate about working across the full software stack to build meaningful applications. 
Extended experience with programming is a must, ideally in C# but this is not necessarily required, since the tooling you will be using is likely so different to anything you have used before. We are *NOT* looking for someone who only cares about the superficial aspects of interfacing with a codebase, rather someone who really understands how the internals work and generally has a passion for finding out things *really* work under the hood (be that any subject, such as governance, business or computer science). Free thinking and independence are also required, but as are being realistic about deadlines and commitments. 
 
Requirements: 
Experience of object oriented programming (C++, C#, Java etc.) 
STEM degree OR relevant industry experience within a programming position 
Flexibility to work in a fast-paced environment, often utilising proprietary methods 
Comfortable working in a team 
(Desirable) Experience working with provisioning, batch scheduling or configuration management tools 
Why should you apply? 
Ambition:  Extremely fast-growing company with an uncapped potential, offering every colleague a broad range of experience and plenty of opportunities for internal movement, as well as rapid career progression. Vibrant company culture full of uniquely talented and friendly colleagues with regular social perks to build camaraderie. 
Flexibility:  Flexible working policy (up to 3 days a week remote); 25 days holiday + bank holidays, informal dress code and excellent work/life balance. Generous maternity/parental leave policies. 
Reward:  Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus and discretionary EMI scheme (company share option scheme). 
Support:  Annual personal training budget, private healthcare, company pension plan, death in service coverage, cycle to work scheme & tech scheme.

 Requirements 
Who we're looking for: 
Product-minded and pragmatic engineers - Front of mind for you is thinking through what the best solution is for the problem the customer is facing. You’ll be given a lot of autonomy to explore solutions from what we build, how it’s designed and what technologies we use. 
Problem-solvers - We’re facing a lot of previously uncharted territory and with that a set of new and unseen challenges. You’re not one to shy away from tackling these sorts of problems. 
One eye on now, one eye on what’s next - Our engineers have a passion for bringing to life distributed systems and scalable and robust architectures. You’ll have a huge role in coming up with how the system will evolve from an architecture and engineering standpoint. 
Culture contributors - We’re a small, close-knit team and recognise the importance of our culture as we continue to grow. You’ll be pivotal in helping shape the early stages and building a team platform that we can grow from. 
Hybrid Working - We’re remote friendly and also have an office in Shoreditch, London, for those who prefer that. We trust you’ll find a work arrangement that works for you. 
Private Health Insurance - Enrolled from Day 1 through Vitality, for when life happens. 
Holiday Leave - 25 days holiday leave, excluding bank holidays. 
Learning Budget - £400 per year to invest in your growth 
WFH Budget - £150 per year to contribute to your home office 
Friendly & Social Team - We have regular team socials both in-person and online, including an annual team trip away (previous years have been in the South of France and Lisbon). 
Working Environment - We’re a small, friendly and close-knit team who value kindness, transparency and autonomy to have an impact 
We also recognise our success is your success, so you’ll receive tax-efficient EMI stock options as part of our annual grant process. 
 
Our recruitment process 
We know your time is important and want to make sure our recruitment process provides both of us a really authentic and meaningful insight into what it would be like working together, so we’re planning on the following stages: 
Intro Call (30 mins) - This will focus on your motivations and interests, your journey to date and some of the experiences you’ve had, along with a chance to share more about Metomic and the Engineering Team. 
Technical Test (max 2 hours) - Instructions will be provided and this should not take any longer than 2 hours. 
Technical Interview (1.5 hours) - Part 1 will involve a technical discussion and Part 2 a whiteboard systems design activity. 
Meet the team (30 mins - 1 hour) - Optional depending on how many of your future colleagues you'll have met during the recruitment steps so far. We think it’s important you have the chance to meet as many of your potential future colleagues as possible and hear directly from them what it’s like in the Engineering team at Metomic.

Over 150 million people use the Lyst app and website each year to shop an assortment of 8 million items via a highly personalised experience. Lyst is a scale-up environment, combining an agile mentality with a proven business model and over a decade of experience. This provides a balance between foundations and structure, and autonomy and pace. Our goal is to be the category leading destination which every fashion shopper uses to decide what to buy. 
Data and technology sit at the heart of everything we do, and we firmly believe that we can only meet our goals by prioritising our team and culture. We give our people the freedom to drive impact and shape the future of our company, within a diverse, inclusive and high-trust environment. We don’t rely on prescriptive rules, policies and procedures to drive results. We trust the judgement and ownership of our team, and prioritise learning and career development, knowing that our success is only possible thanks to our people. Lyst was founded in London in 2010, and has raised over $160m from leading investors including Accel, Balderton, Draper Esprit, Fidelity International, and LVMH. 
We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to come and join our team, to help us build upon and improve our systems that help connect our customers who love fashion with the world’s top fashion brands. 
 
About the team: 
We maintain about half a dozen services with a team of software & machine learning engineers, data scientists and our product manager. 
We care about collecting metrics and properly monitoring our services. 
We work mostly in Python3. 
We use Docker and Kubernetes for managing our services in production. 
We use AWS Step Functions and Metaflow for managing our Data Science models. 
We use CircleCI for continuous integration and moved a lot of our services to be continuously deployed too, which is exciting! 
We work closely with other teams across tribes, and almost all of Lyst engineering uses our services. 
As a Senior Software Engineer on the Search & Rank team at Lyst, you’ll be working on one of the main teams responsible for making connections between products and our customers. We solve some unique problems at Lyst, and with the largest data catalog of fashion products you’ll be learning the best solutions as you go. We aim to build software that’s easy to maintain and low on surprises, which is a goal in many of the design approaches we’ve taken. You’ll have the opportunity for impact by building and maintaining some of the core services at Lyst. You'll be working on productionising solutions to problems involving named entity recognition, search result ranking & diversification, personalisation and recommender systems. 
 
Requirements: 
Experience with building and maintaining microservices 
Ready to contribute to an inclusive and positive working environment for everyone 
Able to communicate clearly and be humble when sharing ideas with everyone on the team 
Previous experience with data science, or an active interest in it, is a plus 
Capable of writing production quality code and doing iterative development, balancing speed to ship and long term maintainability 
Experience with the creation and maintenance of ETL pipelines is a plus 
Have a detail oriented mindset and actively demonstrate curiosity 
We make great use of both the Python and AWS data science ecosystems to power our solutions. Familiarity with Django, REST interfaces, ElasticSearch, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas and related tools would be helpful.

Limejump is a technology platform that manages a large renewable energy network. Our portfolio delivers clean energy to businesses and homes, using renewables and stored energy when it’s needed to meet demand. 
We connect and manage 100% renewable energy through the intelligent control of renewable generators, such as wind turbines and solar panels. We work closely with renewable asset owners, buying their energy and then selling it onto the UK’s grid, giving them simple access to the power market. But, the sun isn’t always shining and the wind isn’t always blowing. We must therefore capture energy for times when there is high demand. By harnessing big data and renewable technology, we accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.
 About the role: 
Limejump seeks a software engineer to help us change the world of energy. We’re looking for someone excited about both green energy and software development to help tackle our reconciliation engine, a core piece of our platform strategy that ingests, curates, and exposes accurate time series data that’s used to drive billing, trading and our data science. 
The data is delivered in real-time, across hundreds of data sources in minute-level blocks, compiled against different customers with different processes, and combined with the complex nature of the energy industry in the UK and abroad. It’s quite the engineering challenge, and we could use some help. 
Your contribution would be more than just code: our team develops its architecture by consensus, so you’d be informing design decisions from day one. We also have a culture of mentorship across the company, so you’d be expected to help others in advancing your skills while also having the opportunity to learn from engineers more experienced than yourself. 
 
Essential Requirements: 
3+ years back-end software development experience, some of which with Python 
Experience working with relational databases, e.g. PostgreSQL 
An open and collaborative attitude with a desire to help others 
A passion for Limejump’s vision of a sustainable future, and a commitment to our values 
Knowledge of standard methodologies and best practices in software development: CI/CD, object-oriented design
 
 Desirable Experience: 
Experience with Django 
ETL/workflow automation experience 
Understanding of container-based architecture – Docker and/or Kubernetes 
Experience with time series databases 
Energy/Fintech industry experience 
 
£1k annual innovation budget to spend on self development coupled with 10% time off work to do it 
Private Medical Insurance with AXA PPP with £0 annual excess 
25 days annual leave…and one extra day for your birthday 
Flexible working options to suit your personal life (including caring responsibility and/or your cultural background) 
Mental wellbeing support with Mental Health First Aiders and Employee Assistance Programme 
Company wide lunch n learns, culturally diverse celebrations and other social events 
Parental leave – up to 12 weeks paid maternity, adoption and shared parental leave 
Subsidised onsite gym membership and weekly fitness classes 
Cycle to Work Scheme – enjoy a carbon free commute on us! 
Life assurance and personal accident insurance 
Other perks and Culture 
In addition to the listed benefits above, day-to-day life at Limejump is packed full of perks. There is flexibility to split your working week between home and office as well as flexible working hours to allow for balancing work with personal responsibility and circumstances. In the office we have ample comfortable breakout and booth spaces to promote a collaborative working environment. We have a pool table, regularly stocked snacks and drinks, casual working attire and the option to occasionally bring your best fur friend into work with you. 
On top of this we have regular company, department, and team socials to bond with colleagues outside of day-to-day work. Some examples of social and knowledge sharing events include our Summer and end of year party, Stress Awareness Month, Ramadan and World Pizza Day.

Most of your work will involve frontend development, but if needed, it would be great to have someone willing to step in on other areas of the platform also. If you’ve never worked with NodeJS before and you’re willing to learn, we’re happy to support you. 
You’ll ideally be someone who enjoys taking ownership of pieces of work (including the technical breakdown and communicating with stakeholders, as well as writing code), takes initiative and enjoys teaching and learning from others. 
As we’re beginning to scale, this role is a great opportunity to help influence how we build up our product, platform and team. We want to help you leverage your strengths and make the role your own.
 Please note that, due to the nature of the work we do with global governments and partners, all employees are required to pass BPSS verification.

Understanding of best practices around building scalable, maintainable and performant designs and code 
Comfortable working in an agile environment

More than 10 million people have chosen to invest in crypto with Luno using our platform, which is available on Apple, Android and as a desktop experience. We’ve enabled over $52bn of transactions and we securely store over $1bn for our customers around the world. 
Our mission is to put the power of crypto in everyone's hands because we believe that giving people access to a robust and fair financial system is a basic human right. We are with customers at every step of their investment journey with clear, jargon-free information and an easy-to-use app experience that helps people get started from as little as $10.

All the crypto we store for our customers is regularly verified by independent auditors. Luno is the trusted guide that will bring crypto to over 1 billion people by 2030.
 About the team: 
Our engineering team (currently ~100 engineers) is split into organisations which we call Fleets. Each Fleet focuses on a core customer journey (onboarding, security, payments, support, new business, growth and marketing etc.). Each of these fleets contains multiple smaller teams called Pods, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of the product. 
Pods will include a product owner, product designer, back-end engineers, Android, iOS and Web developers, who each bring a unique perspective to the problem you are all contributing towards. 
We're agile, use scrum, continuous integration and continuous delivery, deploying to production every single day. 
 
The role in a nutshell: 
We're building teams to help us succeed in our mission to upgrade the world to a better financial system. You’ll be joining a group of highly motivated software engineers who you’ll work collaboratively with across our pods. 
As a fast-growing company with offices around the world, you’ll immediately see how your contributions directly impact both our internal users and client experience. Many of the problems we are solving result in trail blazing solutions which can’t be found on Stack Overflow; so we’re looking for engineers who flourish working in a complex domain. 
 
Your mission will be: 
Design, build and maintain advanced applications for the iOS platform 
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features 
Write testable, maintainable code for robustness and reliability 
Work on bug fixing and improving application performance 
Write code that directly affects users, the company and the Bitcoin ecosystem
 
 A little about you: 
Extensive experience building high quality iOS apps 
Be proficient in Swift 
A deep understanding of UIKit and other core iOS frameworks like persistence and networking 
A keen interest in mobile UX/UI design and the Apple Human Interface Guidelines 
Knowledge of build systems i.e. continuous integration and delivery is an added advantage 
BSc/MSc/PhD in computer science or other technical discipline, or equivalent working experience 
A passion for software development, mobile technology and cryptocurrencies 
To be friendly, transparent, articulate, a team player and driven to succeed 
A work permit for South Africa if you are not a South African citizen 
Don’t be put off if you don’t tick all of the boxes – they’re a guide based on what we’d love to see but we appreciate that excellent software engineers have diverse backgrounds.

Makers is a professional school for software engineers. We began as Europe’s first ‘coding bootcamp’, where career changers retrained as software developers. Since 2013 we’ve helped more than 2,000 people begin a new career in software that way. We’re one of the UK’s biggest software developer apprenticeship providers, helping people train at no cost to them, and we’re not stopping there. We partner with the UK’s most ambitious organisations to design innovative training from DevOps, to Data, Quality Engineering, Leadership, and beyond. 
We’re pretty good at what we do, according to our clients (both developers and employers), industry bodies, the press and the government. We can only get better by working with you.
 About the role: 
You want to be more than just an engineer or a manager or a teacher or a consultant: you want to help people progress in their careers at an unbelievable rate. You want to help them change their lives, to power the organisations they work with, and to make the industry and world a better place. 
As a technical coach at Makers, your role is to help people grow. You’ll join our team of software industry professionals working across all of our programmes, including: 
Immersive Engineering Training -  The core of our approach is immersive engineering training. Learners of all backgrounds join us full-time to gain modern tech engineering skills and become adaptive self-directed learners who can quickly become productive members of any dev team. Coaches run workshops, provide 1:1 support, give feedback and overall ensure that learners learn. 
 
Specialist Training -  Some of our engineers go on to study specific specialisms targeted towards their roles. For example, DevOps and SRE, Engineering Leadership, or use of specific stacks. Coaches take on the challenge of curriculum development and iteration, supported by our educational tools and ethos. Do you have a specialism you want to share? Let’s talk about it! 
 
In-Role Coaching -  The first year in the industry is an exciting and challenging experience. Our technical coaches also support on that journey to help learners navigate the team environment, and accelerate their learning. 
 
Interview Coaching -  Performing well at a technical interview can be a real test for any dev, particularly at the beginning of their career. We coach developers in taking their skills to the next level, navigating the job-hunt, and understanding what they need to demonstrate to interviewers. 
 
Curriculum Development and Innovation -  We’re on the cutting edge of technical education and are always searching for new opportunities to help people learn. No matter your path as a coach, you can expect to gain the skills not just to teach but to design highly effective educational experiences — and potentially advance the field of technical education as a whole. 
You’ll have the opportunity to work in all of these areas as a part of building your practice as an effective technical educator. You may move around to learn new educational techniques and styles, or spend time gaining in-depth expertise in one area. 
 
In all of these areas, you’ll play each of these roles: 
Coach -  Through active listening and questions, you’ll help learners reflect on their learning, their goals, the problems they are facing and the solutions they may try. 
 
Mentor -  You’ll use your own experience as a professional developer to model skills and behaviour necessary to be a dev. 
 
Technical expert  - You’ll use your technical knowledge to give expert feedback to learners as well as to help guide them towards solving their own problems. 
 
Emotional support -  The learning experience can be intense. Learners are often under a lot of stress and financial pressure. You should be there to support them and help them make the best choices they can. 
 
Education expert -  Using recognised educational tools, you’ll help the learners organise their learning, sequence material, rebuild their mental models and ultimately become independent self-learners. 
We’re building the best software engineering school in the world. We want our approach to be the foundation of how technical skills are taught everywhere. Come and be a part of it. 
 
You should: 
 
Have experience as a professional software engineer (any background — including DevOps, SRE, SDET, Data) 
Have experience helping people to grow (coaching, teaching, mentoring, tutoring, or something similar. This might be informal as part of a hobby or volunteering, or it could have been as part of a management role) 
Be comfortable talking to people (you’ll need to coach learners 1:1, as well as run workshops in front of groups of up to 30 learners) 
Be a self-led learner yourself (both to model behaviour to learners, and because our culture will need you to proactively look for information and feedback)

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems. 
The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration. 
You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level. 
Technologies We Use 
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. 
TypeScript and React are central to our front-end development. 
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library. 
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand. 
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub. 
What We Value

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
 
 Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location.

On top of this, we use an in-house batch scheduler to execute jobs that run programs written in a proprietary functional relational language, which essentially power all our data analytics tools. Due to the complex nature of our batches, the scheduler contains many advanced features that have a lot in common with state-of-the-art orchestration engines (e.g. Ansible), and is one of our most widely used internal product: engineers and quant developers use it to analyze in depth the behavior of their scripts, and client-facing teams employ it to set up and monitor production batches. 
The scheduling software, currently in its second iteration, is made of a single mission control node and multiple agents installed on each machine in our cloud environment and would highly benefit from a series of improvements in terms of usability, batch structure, data normalization and introduction of new helpful features. Your role will be to design and develop a maintainable, robust and fail-safe system based on a modular and configurable job structure. 
 
About the role: 
This role will: 
Include intuitive monitoring and scheduling interfaces 
Provide efficient ways for both engineers and non-technical users to interact with the scheduler 
Support core and advanced features such as: variable overrides, task loops, conditional execution, privileges and permissions, intelligent error-handling 
This will involve exposure to the full development stack as you will need to understand business and technical requirements and translate them into deliverables, working with both backend and frontend components; you will also be responsible for writing automated tests and proper documentation. 
You do not need to be an expert in all aspects mentioned above, but it is essential that you have a strong desire to constantly learn, and to develop and own a critical software project upon which production systems will depend: we think this will be very interesting for someone passionate about working across the full software stack to build meaningful applications. 
Extended experience with programming is a must, ideally in C# but this is not necessarily required, since the tooling you will be using is likely so different to anything you have used before. We are *NOT* looking for someone who only cares about the superficial aspects of interfacing with a codebase, rather someone who really understands how the internals work and generally has a passion for finding out things *really* work under the hood (be that any subject, such as governance, business or computer science). Free thinking and independence are also required, but as are being realistic about deadlines and commitments. 
 
Requirements: 
Experience of object oriented programming (C++, C#, Java etc.) 
STEM degree OR relevant industry experience within a programming position 
Flexibility to work in a fast-paced environment, often utilising proprietary methods 
Comfortable working in a team 
(Desirable) Experience working with provisioning, batch scheduling or configuration management tools 
Why should you apply? 
Ambition:  Extremely fast-growing company with an uncapped potential, offering every colleague a broad range of experience and plenty of opportunities for internal movement, as well as rapid career progression. Vibrant company culture full of uniquely talented and friendly colleagues with regular social perks to build camaraderie. 
Flexibility:  Flexible working policy (up to 3 days a week remote); 25 days holiday + bank holidays, informal dress code and excellent work/life balance. Generous maternity/parental leave policies. 
Reward:  Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus and discretionary EMI scheme (company share option scheme). 
Support:  Annual personal training budget, private healthcare, company pension plan, death in service coverage, cycle to work scheme & tech scheme.

 Requirements 
Who we're looking for: 
Product-minded and pragmatic engineers - Front of mind for you is thinking through what the best solution is for the problem the customer is facing. You’ll be given a lot of autonomy to explore solutions from what we build, how it’s designed and what technologies we use. 
Problem-solvers - We’re facing a lot of previously uncharted territory and with that a set of new and unseen challenges. You’re not one to shy away from tackling these sorts of problems. 
One eye on now, one eye on what’s next - Our engineers have a passion for bringing to life distributed systems and scalable and robust architectures. You’ll have a huge role in coming up with how the system will evolve from an architecture and engineering standpoint. 
Culture contributors - We’re a small, close-knit team and recognise the importance of our culture as we continue to grow. You’ll be pivotal in helping shape the early stages and building a team platform that we can grow from. 
Hybrid Working - We’re remote friendly and also have an office in Shoreditch, London, for those who prefer that. We trust you’ll find a work arrangement that works for you. 
Private Health Insurance - Enrolled from Day 1 through Vitality, for when life happens. 
Holiday Leave - 25 days holiday leave, excluding bank holidays. 
Learning Budget - £400 per year to invest in your growth 
WFH Budget - £150 per year to contribute to your home office 
Friendly & Social Team - We have regular team socials both in-person and online, including an annual team trip away (previous years have been in the South of France and Lisbon). 
Working Environment - We’re a small, friendly and close-knit team who value kindness, transparency and autonomy to have an impact 
We also recognise our success is your success, so you’ll receive tax-efficient EMI stock options as part of our annual grant process. 
 
Our recruitment process 
We know your time is important and want to make sure our recruitment process provides both of us a really authentic and meaningful insight into what it would be like working together, so we’re planning on the following stages: 
Intro Call (30 mins) - This will focus on your motivations and interests, your journey to date and some of the experiences you’ve had, along with a chance to share more about Metomic and the Engineering Team. 
Technical Test (max 2 hours) - Instructions will be provided and this should not take any longer than 2 hours. 
Technical Interview (1.5 hours) - Part 1 will involve a technical discussion and Part 2 a whiteboard systems design activity. 
Meet the team (30 mins - 1 hour) - Optional depending on how many of your future colleagues you'll have met during the recruitment steps so far. We think it’s important you have the chance to meet as many of your potential future colleagues as possible and hear directly from them what it’s like in the Engineering team at Metomic.

Over 150 million people use the Lyst app and website each year to shop an assortment of 8 million items via a highly personalised experience. Lyst is a scale-up environment, combining an agile mentality with a proven business model and over a decade of experience. This provides a balance between foundations and structure, and autonomy and pace. Our goal is to be the category leading destination which every fashion shopper uses to decide what to buy. 
Data and technology sit at the heart of everything we do, and we firmly believe that we can only meet our goals by prioritising our team and culture. We give our people the freedom to drive impact and shape the future of our company, within a diverse, inclusive and high-trust environment. We don’t rely on prescriptive rules, policies and procedures to drive results. We trust the judgement and ownership of our team, and prioritise learning and career development, knowing that our success is only possible thanks to our people. Lyst was founded in London in 2010, and has raised over $160m from leading investors including Accel, Balderton, Draper Esprit, Fidelity International, and LVMH. 
We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to come and join our team, to help us build upon and improve our systems that help connect our customers who love fashion with the world’s top fashion brands. 
 
About the team: 
We maintain about half a dozen services with a team of software & machine learning engineers, data scientists and our product manager. 
We care about collecting metrics and properly monitoring our services. 
We work mostly in Python3. 
We use Docker and Kubernetes for managing our services in production. 
We use AWS Step Functions and Metaflow for managing our Data Science models. 
We use CircleCI for continuous integration and moved a lot of our services to be continuously deployed too, which is exciting! 
We work closely with other teams across tribes, and almost all of Lyst engineering uses our services. 
As a Senior Software Engineer on the Search & Rank team at Lyst, you’ll be working on one of the main teams responsible for making connections between products and our customers. We solve some unique problems at Lyst, and with the largest data catalog of fashion products you’ll be learning the best solutions as you go. We aim to build software that’s easy to maintain and low on surprises, which is a goal in many of the design approaches we’ve taken. You’ll have the opportunity for impact by building and maintaining some of the core services at Lyst. You'll be working on productionising solutions to problems involving named entity recognition, search result ranking & diversification, personalisation and recommender systems. 
 
Requirements: 
Experience with building and maintaining microservices 
Ready to contribute to an inclusive and positive working environment for everyone

We make great use of both the Python and AWS data science ecosystems to power our solutions. Familiarity with Django, REST interfaces, ElasticSearch, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas and related tools would be helpful. 
If you’ve programmed in a different language and not worked with Python before, that’s OK, knowing how to code is a transferable skill. Equally if you’ve never used AWS before and have experience with an alternative cloud provider, that’s OK too. There’s time to learn on the job and a supportive, knowledgeable team will help you. We believe in having a curious mindset and your ability to learn to do the job is more important than a checklist of must haves. 
You get 29 days' time off throughout the year to take a well earned rest, in addition to the 8 public bank holidays 
The Lyst Clothing Benefit. We're a fashion company so we'll give you £250 to spend on the site in Year 1, £500 in Year 2, £750 in Year 3 and £1000 from Year 4 onwards. You're going to look fantastic! 
Private Healthcare by Vitality. Your health is important to us which is why we offer all employees a comprehensive healthcare scheme from the day that you start. 
Conferences and events. We’re big on learning, so all Lysters are allocated an individual training&development budget of £1,000.

Limejump is a technology platform that manages a large renewable energy network. Our portfolio delivers clean energy to businesses and homes, using renewables and stored energy when it’s needed to meet demand. 
We connect and manage 100% renewable energy through the intelligent control of renewable generators, such as wind turbines and solar panels. We work closely with renewable asset owners, buying their energy and then selling it onto the UK’s grid, giving them simple access to the power market. But, the sun isn’t always shining and the wind isn’t always blowing. We must therefore capture energy for times when there is high demand. By harnessing big data and renewable technology, we accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.
 About the role: 
Limejump seeks a software engineer to help us change the world of energy. We’re looking for someone excited about both green energy and software development to help tackle our reconciliation engine, a core piece of our platform strategy that ingests, curates, and exposes accurate time series data that’s used to drive billing, trading and our data science. 
The data is delivered in real-time, across hundreds of data sources in minute-level blocks, compiled against different customers with different processes, and combined with the complex nature of the energy industry in the UK and abroad. It’s quite the engineering challenge, and we could use some help. 
Your contribution would be more than just code: our team develops its architecture by consensus, so you’d be informing design decisions from day one. We also have a culture of mentorship across the company, so you’d be expected to help others in advancing your skills while also having the opportunity to learn from engineers more experienced than yourself. 
 
Essential Requirements: 
3+ years back-end software development experience, some of which with Python 
Experience working with relational databases, e.g. PostgreSQL 
An open and collaborative attitude with a desire to help others 
A passion for Limejump’s vision of a sustainable future, and a commitment to our values

Experience with Django 
ETL/workflow automation experience 
Understanding of container-based architecture – Docker and/or Kubernetes 
Experience with time series databases 
Energy/Fintech industry experience 
 
£1k annual innovation budget to spend on self development coupled with 10% time off work to do it 
Private Medical Insurance with AXA PPP with £0 annual excess 
25 days annual leave…and one extra day for your birthday 
Flexible working options to suit your personal life (including caring responsibility and/or your cultural background) 
Mental wellbeing support with Mental Health First Aiders and Employee Assistance Programme 
Company wide lunch n learns, culturally diverse celebrations and other social events 
Parental leave – up to 12 weeks paid maternity, adoption and shared parental leave 
Subsidised onsite gym membership and weekly fitness classes 
Cycle to Work Scheme – enjoy a carbon free commute on us! 
Life assurance and personal accident insurance 
Other perks and Culture 
In addition to the listed benefits above, day-to-day life at Limejump is packed full of perks. There is flexibility to split your working week between home and office as well as flexible working hours to allow for balancing work with personal responsibility and circumstances. In the office we have ample comfortable breakout and booth spaces to promote a collaborative working environment. We have a pool table, regularly stocked snacks and drinks, casual working attire and the option to occasionally bring your best fur friend into work with you. 
On top of this we have regular company, department, and team socials to bond with colleagues outside of day-to-day work.

Most of your work will involve frontend development, but if needed, it would be great to have someone willing to step in on other areas of the platform also. If you’ve never worked with NodeJS before and you’re willing to learn, we’re happy to support you. 
You’ll ideally be someone who enjoys taking ownership of pieces of work (including the technical breakdown and communicating with stakeholders, as well as writing code), takes initiative and enjoys teaching and learning from others. 
As we’re beginning to scale, this role is a great opportunity to help influence how we build up our product, platform and team. We want to help you leverage your strengths and make the role your own.
 Please note that, due to the nature of the work we do with global governments and partners, all employees are required to pass BPSS verification. 
 
Requirements 
Solid communication and interpersonal skills 
Strong JavaScript skills 
Experience with React 
An eye for detail and the ability to reproduce designs as high quality code 
A willingness to learn and help others grow 
Willing to get stuck in wherever you can provide the most value, even if it's an area that's new to you 
Demonstrated experience in delivering production ready code on several projects - we’re open to people both at the mid and senior levels of their career 
Understanding of best practices around building scalable, maintainable and performant designs and code 
Comfortable working in an agile environment 
Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women and people of colour are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. Apolitical is dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Our platform is used by hundreds of companies to enable over twelve billion kid-safe digital transactions across advertising, community and parental consent every month. SuperAwesome has pioneered the kidtech sector, delivering engagement with the under-13 audience built around privacy and responsibility. 
Joining the Epic Games family is propelling the kidtech sector to new heights. 
 
About the role: 
Our teams are growing rapidly and we’re hiring a Software Engineer to take our products to the next level of scale. 
As a Software Engineer at SuperAwesome your main responsibilities will be: 
You will keep the quality bar high by continuously evolving the system while keeping it simple 
You will focus on having the highest impact on the product 
You will join one of our product teams as an owner of one of our products, these include AwesomeAds, Kids Web Services, PopJam and Rukkaz, as well as internal facing teams. 
You will have your say in the product roadmap and help the team and the Product Manager to make the most informed decisions to break down complex tech deliverables into simple and understandable user stories. 
Quality is key for us, so you will ensure all product components are built to an appropriate level of quality for the stage (alpha/beta/production), deliver products using the appropriate level of testing and monitoring, fail fast, and learn and iterate frequently. You will champion continuous improvement and always aim to improve the product your team owns and measure your impact with the appropriate tech, product, or delivery metrics. 
 
Responsibilities: 
You’ll work across the full stack depending on where you can drive the highest impact: back-end, front-end as well as testing and cloud infrastructure 
You’ll work with your team to design and implement features and services for the product your team owns, and keep the design choices well documented and explained 
You will master one or more domains and will break complex goals into simple and iterative deliverables 
Commit to high-speed iterations, high code quality, and continuous improvement via agile processes 
Ensure long-term quality, scalability and maintainability of our systems 
You’ll champion the devops culture, treat operations with a mission critical mindset, and support the live system in production, including participation in our out-of-hours on-call rota 
 
Our tech stack:
 Stack is entirely cloud native, and it includes technologies such as AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Druid, Redis, ELK, Datadog, Pagerduty, Node.js and Typescript. 
 
Requirements: 
We wholeheartedly believe a good engineer can pick up any new technology in a reasonable amount of time and you’ll be given training and help during your onboarding to become fully proficient with our stack.
 What we expect you to already have is good will, as well as a deep understanding of full-stack software development life-cycle, devops methodologies, testing, and tooling. In short, please apply if you are interested in working with our stack! As soon as you join you will have an on-boarding plan tailored to you, challenging and bringing you up to speed. 
We’ll ask you about your previous experiences building large and complex high-throughput web systems, and we’ll hear the stories you’ll be willing to share about microservices, event-driven architectures, databases, or any tech challenge you’ve enjoyed. 
We’ll want to know how you went about improving the quality, security, scalability, and observability of the products you worked on, and how you would try to repeat that success at SuperAwesome. 
DevOps practices are an integral part of our culture, and we’ll want to hear what aspect of them you prefer, and what worked well for you out of the box, or how you adapted them to your needs. 
In a nutshell, we’re looking for a great engineer, and we’ll do our best to identify the greatness in you ❤️ 
About you as a person: 
You think about things critically - we’re the first to do what we do in this industry, so you’ll come across new problems every day 
You’ll fearlessly attack problems - we think the tools you know now are secondary to having the mindset to fix things, i.e. you’re a problem solver and not just a builder 
You like working in a team - we have an agile development environment and get stuff done together in multi-disciplinary teams 
You’re flexible and adaptable - we have multiple teams working on complementary but different products, so you’ll thrive on variety 
About your skills: 
You are proficient in backend and frontend development, and you have experience developing large and complex web applications and building high throughput systems with microservices and/or event-driven architectures and both relational and non-relational databases.

But that’s not the case. Technology is about change. Not the zeros and ones. But the people, the culture and the impact it has on the world. At Red Badger we believe you cannot build successful technology without simultaneously empowering your people to embrace it. This requires change at every level. 
Red Badger was born and developed by Cain, Stu and Dave in 2010. They had a shared ambition to create a business that turned the traditional consulting model on its head: no sales team; no RFP processes, just great people doing great work that focused on quality, value and collaboration. 
The best bit about Red Badger is, of course, the team. We’ve been around for 8+ years now and we are over 100 strong. We are really proud of our people; we support and learn a lot from each other; we work really hard but have fun doing it. We are a diverse group made up of 22 different nationalities, speaking 17 different languages. 
We are based at Old Street in the heart of “tech city” and get thoroughly stuck in with the brilliant community around us. We run several meetups including the hugely popular React London, invite other groups to host their events in our office such as Lua London and Ladies Who Code and speak at events like Digital Shoreditch and LNUG.
 About the role: 
We’re looking for a Software Engineer to join our digital product delivery function. Red Badger delivers high-quality digital products using a lean delivery process and multidisciplinary, cross-functional teams. 
The work we do for our clients involves dealing with the core complexities of their business and the technology we employ varies from project to project. 
You are well on your way to having good knowledge and experience in one or more programming languages in both the frontend and backend of the stack, excited to dig deeper into the areas you already know as well as expand your skills into different languages, technologies and practices. 
You are passionate about the craft of software development and contribute to technical and non-technical discussions that help shape the direction of digital product delivery. You are able to work independently, as well as collaboratively, on user stories within an agile delivery environment and are versed in modern software delivery practices. You care about creating quality software that meets the needs of our client’s vision and goals, in a thoughtfully pragmatic way. 
As well as contributing to production-grade code bases, you will also be proactive in working directly with the client to help shape and move the project forward and, where required, helping to upskill and embed good development practices within existing, newly formed or client/Badger blended cross-functional teams. 
 
Key Responsibilities: 
Discipline Expertise: 
Working collaboratively in a cross-functional team of designers, engineers & testers 
Employ modern development practices to ship high-quality software 
Ability to adapt to new languages and frameworks 
Coach & support peers 
Agile Ways of Working:

Own the delivery of user stories end-to-end working with agile principles 
Actively contribute to agile ceremonies 
Consulting with clients: 
Proactively engage with clients to shape and move the project forward 
Upskilling and embedding modern software practices in client teams where necessary
 
 Your experience: 
 
It’d be great if you have experience with: 
Frontend web technologies (e.g. JavaScript, Typescript, CSS, HTML, etc.) 
 
Backend technologies (e.g. Node.js, Java, Go, Rust, etc.) 
 
Effective source-control management using Git 
 
Test automation following Test Driven Development practices including unit testing, API testing, and end-to-end testing 
 
Working with lean and agile practices (e.g. Kanban, Scrum, etc.) 
 
Collaborating in cross-functional teams
 
 It’d be amazing if you can also: 
Work with virtualisation and orchestration tools (e.g. VMs, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.) 
 
Build, maintain and debug CI/CD pipelines (e.g. Jenkins, CircleCI, Github Actions, etc.) 
 
Make use of modern UI data layer technologies (i.e. Relay, GraphQL, Apollo, etc.) 
 
Understand, debug and help contribute to evolving cloud based architectures (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) 
 
Work with and debug data storage layer technologies (MySQL, Postgres, BigQuery etc.) 
 
Support a live system, respond to alerts, diagnose problems using logs and observability tooling, triage and resolve incidents

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
 
 Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems. 
The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration. 
You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level. 
Technologies We Use 
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. 
TypeScript and React are central to our front-end development. 
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library. 
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand. 
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub. 
What We Value 
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work. 
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems. 
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building. 
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. 
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.

Our backend is a mix of classic relational databases, as well as a custom-designed NoSQL data store optimised for write once, read many operations. We also make heavy use of code generation to automate repetitive tasks. 
A successful candidate would spend most of their time working on the front-end and server-side components of our websites, and be comfortable enough to propose new approaches and ideas. The candidate will also be able to coordinate with internal teams who make use of our front-end library to prioritise new features, have a close relationship with our client support teams to prioritise fixes, and coordinate releases to client websites.

Revmo is a new technology startup with a presence in the UK and the US. Our platform uses graph theory to help individuals and organisations make new connections by finding latent connections in their networks, their company’s networks to potential investors, customers or hires. 
Our stack includes JavaScript, React, Python, FastAPI, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Github Actions, and AWS but nothing is set in stone. For example, we’d like to phase out JavaScript in favour of TypeScript. We're finding new ways to improve things, driving our platform forward, faster. 
In this role, you should be able to work independently, with little supervision, to provide a mixture of mentoring and support to less experienced colleagues and contributions to the platform features, system design, and methodology. You should be able to communicate progress and challenges to your colleagues and our leadership; fostering collaboration and agility. 
You should believe in fast moving, small teams who achieve results through agile methodologies, collaboration, engineering skill, and pragmatism. We want you to help us to build an open, high-performing culture. 
 
About You 
You should have a strong software engineering background, preferably full-stack, with a wealth of experience to share around design patterns, cloud infrastructure, agile, and DevOps. 
This should be backed by relevant industry experience. 
You are comfortable building in Python and/or JavaScript (including TypeScript) 
You’ll know the entire development lifecycle in a web/cloud environment and software engineering best practices well, including cloud-native architecture, design, code, unit testing, integration testing, code review, and documentation. 
You thrive in a fast-paced environment that emphasises results over process and rapid iteration over planning. 
You’re keen to share your experience with less experienced team members, mentor them, and shape the future of the company. 
Be experienced in automated testing, ideally TDD but also BDD-style end-to-end tests.
 
 Benefits 
We’re still young and there’s plenty of opportunity to grow with the company as well as influencing the direction that the company takes. We offer a competitive early employee compensation package including equity. In addition, we offer a pension plan, private healthcare, and some flexible working.

On top of this, we use an in-house batch scheduler to execute jobs that run programs written in a proprietary functional relational language, which essentially power all our data analytics tools. Due to the complex nature of our batches, the scheduler contains many advanced features that have a lot in common with state-of-the-art orchestration engines (e.g. Ansible), and is one of our most widely used internal product: engineers and quant developers use it to analyze in depth the behavior of their scripts, and client-facing teams employ it to set up and monitor production batches. 
The scheduling software, currently in its second iteration, is made of a single mission control node and multiple agents installed on each machine in our cloud environment and would highly benefit from a series of improvements in terms of usability, batch structure, data normalization and introduction of new helpful features. Your role will be to design and develop a maintainable, robust and fail-safe system based on a modular and configurable job structure. 
 
About the role: 
This role will: 
Include intuitive monitoring and scheduling interfaces 
Provide efficient ways for both engineers and non-technical users to interact with the scheduler 
Support core and advanced features such as: variable overrides, task loops, conditional execution, privileges and permissions, intelligent error-handling 
This will involve exposure to the full development stack as you will need to understand business and technical requirements and translate them into deliverables, working with both backend and frontend components; you will also be responsible for writing automated tests and proper documentation. 
You do not need to be an expert in all aspects mentioned above, but it is essential that you have a strong desire to constantly learn, and to develop and own a critical software project upon which production systems will depend: we think this will be very interesting for someone passionate about working across the full software stack to build meaningful applications. 
Extended experience with programming is a must, ideally in C# but this is not necessarily required, since the tooling you will be using is likely so different to anything you have used before. We are *NOT* looking for someone who only cares about the superficial aspects of interfacing with a codebase, rather someone who really understands how the internals work and generally has a passion for finding out things *really* work under the hood (be that any subject, such as governance, business or computer science). Free thinking and independence are also required, but as are being realistic about deadlines and commitments. 
 
Requirements: 
Experience of object oriented programming (C++, C#, Java etc.) 
STEM degree OR relevant industry experience within a programming position 
Flexibility to work in a fast-paced environment, often utilising proprietary methods 
Comfortable working in a team 
(Desirable) Experience working with provisioning, batch scheduling or configuration management tools 
Why should you apply? 
Ambition:  Extremely fast-growing company with an uncapped potential, offering every colleague a broad range of experience and plenty of opportunities for internal movement, as well as rapid career progression. Vibrant company culture full of uniquely talented and friendly colleagues with regular social perks to build camaraderie. 
Flexibility:  Flexible working policy (up to 3 days a week remote); 25 days holiday + bank holidays, informal dress code and excellent work/life balance. Generous maternity/parental leave policies. 
Reward:  Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus and discretionary EMI scheme (company share option scheme). 
Support:  Annual personal training budget, private healthcare, company pension plan, death in service coverage, cycle to work scheme & tech scheme.

 Requirements 
Who we're looking for: 
Product-minded and pragmatic engineers - Front of mind for you is thinking through what the best solution is for the problem the customer is facing. You’ll be given a lot of autonomy to explore solutions from what we build, how it’s designed and what technologies we use. 
Problem-solvers - We’re facing a lot of previously uncharted territory and with that a set of new and unseen challenges. You’re not one to shy away from tackling these sorts of problems. 
One eye on now, one eye on what’s next - Our engineers have a passion for bringing to life distributed systems and scalable and robust architectures. You’ll have a huge role in coming up with how the system will evolve from an architecture and engineering standpoint. 
Culture contributors - We’re a small, close-knit team and recognise the importance of our culture as we continue to grow. You’ll be pivotal in helping shape the early stages and building a team platform that we can grow from. 
Hybrid Working - We’re remote friendly and also have an office in Shoreditch, London, for those who prefer that. We trust you’ll find a work arrangement that works for you. 
Private Health Insurance - Enrolled from Day 1 through Vitality, for when life happens. 
Holiday Leave - 25 days holiday leave, excluding bank holidays. 
Learning Budget - £400 per year to invest in your growth 
WFH Budget - £150 per year to contribute to your home office 
Friendly & Social Team - We have regular team socials both in-person and online, including an annual team trip away (previous years have been in the South of France and Lisbon). 
Working Environment - We’re a small, friendly and close-knit team who value kindness, transparency and autonomy to have an impact 
We also recognise our success is your success, so you’ll receive tax-efficient EMI stock options as part of our annual grant process. 
 
Our recruitment process 
We know your time is important and want to make sure our recruitment process provides both of us a really authentic and meaningful insight into what it would be like working together, so we’re planning on the following stages: 
Intro Call (30 mins) - This will focus on your motivations and interests, your journey to date and some of the experiences you’ve had, along with a chance to share more about Metomic and the Engineering Team. 
Technical Test (max 2 hours) - Instructions will be provided and this should not take any longer than 2 hours. 
Technical Interview (1.5 hours) - Part 1 will involve a technical discussion and Part 2 a whiteboard systems design activity. 
Meet the team (30 mins - 1 hour) - Optional depending on how many of your future colleagues you'll have met during the recruitment steps so far. We think it’s important you have the chance to meet as many of your potential future colleagues as possible and hear directly from them what it’s like in the Engineering team at Metomic.

Over 150 million people use the Lyst app and website each year to shop an assortment of 8 million items via a highly personalised experience. Lyst is a scale-up environment, combining an agile mentality with a proven business model and over a decade of experience. This provides a balance between foundations and structure, and autonomy and pace. Our goal is to be the category leading destination which every fashion shopper uses to decide what to buy. 
Data and technology sit at the heart of everything we do, and we firmly believe that we can only meet our goals by prioritising our team and culture. We give our people the freedom to drive impact and shape the future of our company, within a diverse, inclusive and high-trust environment. We don’t rely on prescriptive rules, policies and procedures to drive results. We trust the judgement and ownership of our team, and prioritise learning and career development, knowing that our success is only possible thanks to our people. Lyst was founded in London in 2010, and has raised over $160m from leading investors including Accel, Balderton, Draper Esprit, Fidelity International, and LVMH. 
We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to come and join our team, to help us build upon and improve our systems that help connect our customers who love fashion with the world’s top fashion brands. 
 
About the team: 
We maintain about half a dozen services with a team of software & machine learning engineers, data scientists and our product manager. 
We care about collecting metrics and properly monitoring our services. 
We work mostly in Python3. 
We use Docker and Kubernetes for managing our services in production. 
We use AWS Step Functions and Metaflow for managing our Data Science models. 
We use CircleCI for continuous integration and moved a lot of our services to be continuously deployed too, which is exciting! 
We work closely with other teams across tribes, and almost all of Lyst engineering uses our services. 
As a Senior Software Engineer on the Search & Rank team at Lyst, you’ll be working on one of the main teams responsible for making connections between products and our customers. We solve some unique problems at Lyst, and with the largest data catalog of fashion products you’ll be learning the best solutions as you go. We aim to build software that’s easy to maintain and low on surprises, which is a goal in many of the design approaches we’ve taken. You’ll have the opportunity for impact by building and maintaining some of the core services at Lyst. You'll be working on productionising solutions to problems involving named entity recognition, search result ranking & diversification, personalisation and recommender systems. 
 
Requirements: 
Experience with building and maintaining microservices 
Ready to contribute to an inclusive and positive working environment for everyone 
Able to communicate clearly and be humble when sharing ideas with everyone on the team 
Previous experience with data science, or an active interest in it, is a plus 
Capable of writing production quality code and doing iterative development, balancing speed to ship and long term maintainability 
Experience with the creation and maintenance of ETL pipelines is a plus 
Have a detail oriented mindset and actively demonstrate curiosity 
We make great use of both the Python and AWS data science ecosystems to power our solutions. Familiarity with Django, REST interfaces, ElasticSearch, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas and related tools would be helpful. 
If you’ve programmed in a different language and not worked with Python before, that’s OK, knowing how to code is a transferable skill. Equally if you’ve never used AWS before and have experience with an alternative cloud provider, that’s OK too. There’s time to learn on the job and a supportive, knowledgeable team will help you. We believe in having a curious mindset and your ability to learn to do the job is more important than a checklist of must haves. 
You get 29 days' time off throughout the year to take a well earned rest, in addition to the 8 public bank holidays 
The Lyst Clothing Benefit. We're a fashion company so we'll give you £250 to spend on the site in Year 1, £500 in Year 2, £750 in Year 3 and £1000 from Year 4 onwards. You're going to look fantastic! 
Private Healthcare by Vitality. Your health is important to us which is why we offer all employees a comprehensive healthcare scheme from the day that you start. 
Conferences and events. We’re big on learning, so all Lysters are allocated an individual training&development budget of £1,000.

Most of your work will involve frontend development, but if needed, it would be great to have someone willing to step in on other areas of the platform also. If you’ve never worked with NodeJS before and you’re willing to learn, we’re happy to support you. 
You’ll ideally be someone who enjoys taking ownership of pieces of work (including the technical breakdown and communicating with stakeholders, as well as writing code), takes initiative and enjoys teaching and learning from others. 
As we’re beginning to scale, this role is a great opportunity to help influence how we build up our product, platform and team. We want to help you leverage your strengths and make the role your own.
 Please note that, due to the nature of the work we do with global governments and partners, all employees are required to pass BPSS verification. 
 
Requirements 
Solid communication and interpersonal skills

Demonstrated experience in delivering production ready code on several projects - we’re open to people both at the mid and senior levels of their career 
Understanding of best practices around building scalable, maintainable and performant designs and code 
Comfortable working in an agile environment

Limejump is a technology platform that manages a large renewable energy network. Our portfolio delivers clean energy to businesses and homes, using renewables and stored energy when it’s needed to meet demand. 
We connect and manage 100% renewable energy through the intelligent control of renewable generators, such as wind turbines and solar panels. We work closely with renewable asset owners, buying their energy and then selling it onto the UK’s grid, giving them simple access to the power market. But, the sun isn’t always shining and the wind isn’t always blowing. We must therefore capture energy for times when there is high demand. By harnessing big data and renewable technology, we accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.
 About the role: 
Limejump seeks a software engineer to help us change the world of energy. We’re looking for someone excited about both green energy and software development to help tackle our reconciliation engine, a core piece of our platform strategy that ingests, curates, and exposes accurate time series data that’s used to drive billing, trading and our data science. 
The data is delivered in real-time, across hundreds of data sources in minute-level blocks, compiled against different customers with different processes, and combined with the complex nature of the energy industry in the UK and abroad. It’s quite the engineering challenge, and we could use some help. 
Your contribution would be more than just code: our team develops its architecture by consensus, so you’d be informing design decisions from day one. We also have a culture of mentorship across the company, so you’d be expected to help others in advancing your skills while also having the opportunity to learn from engineers more experienced than yourself. 
 
Essential Requirements: 
3+ years back-end software development experience, some of which with Python 
Experience working with relational databases, e.g. PostgreSQL 
An open and collaborative attitude with a desire to help others 
A passion for Limejump’s vision of a sustainable future, and a commitment to our values 
Knowledge of standard methodologies and best practices in software development: CI/CD, object-oriented design
 
 Desirable Experience: 
Experience with Django 
ETL/workflow automation experience 
Understanding of container-based architecture – Docker and/or Kubernetes 
Experience with time series databases 
Energy/Fintech industry experience 
 
£1k annual innovation budget to spend on self development coupled with 10% time off work to do it 
Private Medical Insurance with AXA PPP with £0 annual excess 
25 days annual leave…and one extra day for your birthday 
Flexible working options to suit your personal life (including caring responsibility and/or your cultural background) 
Mental wellbeing support with Mental Health First Aiders and Employee Assistance Programme 
Company wide lunch n learns, culturally diverse celebrations and other social events 
Parental leave – up to 12 weeks paid maternity, adoption and shared parental leave 
Subsidised onsite gym membership and weekly fitness classes 
Cycle to Work Scheme – enjoy a carbon free commute on us! 
Life assurance and personal accident insurance 
Other perks and Culture 
In addition to the listed benefits above, day-to-day life at Limejump is packed full of perks. There is flexibility to split your working week between home and office as well as flexible working hours to allow for balancing work with personal responsibility and circumstances. In the office we have ample comfortable breakout and booth spaces to promote a collaborative working environment. We have a pool table, regularly stocked snacks and drinks, casual working attire and the option to occasionally bring your best fur friend into work with you. 
On top of this we have regular company, department, and team socials to bond with colleagues outside of day-to-day work. Some examples of social and knowledge sharing events include our Summer and end of year party, Stress Awareness Month, Ramadan and World Pizza Day. To see what we arranged for these events and more, check out our socials on our Instagram page here.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
 
 Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
 
 Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location. 
Requirements 
Security clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance.

The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration. 
You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level. 
Technologies We Use 
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. 
TypeScript and React are central to our front-end development. 
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library. 
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand. 
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub. 
What We Value 
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work. 
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems. 
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building. 
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. 
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems.

Front-end 
You’ll implement our designs to craft an amazing SaaS experience. You’ll go the extra mile to ensure Omnea is pixel perfect and represents a best-in-class user experience. 
You’ll ensure our platform stays responsive and looking sharp across different resolutions, different platforms and meets all our accessibility targets.  Backend 
You’ll build our data integration systems from scratch, learning by doing. You’ll take concepts and PoC’s from design to production. You’ll work with our integration partners to design how we communicate with their systems and data. You’ll craft our REST APIs and micro-services taking into account our security and compliance obligations. 
 
What can you expect? 
Engineering 
You’ll build a beautiful SaaS application using JavaScript/Typescript from scratch to deploy to tens of thousands of users in a matter of months. You’ll need to write a lot of code and get your hands dirty in plenty of engineering challenges. You’ll write resilient software that can handle hundreds of thousands of users.  Culture 
You’ll participate in the “startup” hustle of getting features shipped quickly following agile best practices alongside a committed team. You’ll take part in coding reviews, up-skilling new employees and pair programming to diagnose issues. ️ Product 
You’ll implement features that have direct impact and add value to our customers. You’ll work closely with the founders to implement the vision of Omnea. 
 
About you 
You’re experienced (3+ years)  with building beautiful web apps having designed and implemented features from start to finish using JavaScript or Typescript. 
You’re ready to learn.  You want to absorb everything there is about building enterprise-grade software and improve your capabilities as a software engineer. You want to understand what it takes to build something from scratch to scale. 
You’re product-minded.  You have a sense for a great user experience and feel for when something is off. You find fulfilment in building beautiful products that people actually love to use. 
You want to take ownership.  You feel it’s your time to take ownership of the features you develop and deliver them to a standard you know you are able to. 
You’re ready to get a lot done.  You have a bias to action and want to accelerate your engineering career rapidly. 
You’re entrepreneurially-minded.  You are excited about the opportunity of joining as an early member of the engineering team and taking something from 0 to 1. You know it’s going to take hard work and lots of learning but you are ready to take it on. 
You’re a  team builder.  You make the team around you stronger. You’re happy to take the extra time to explain things, provide actionable feedback, and level up those around you. 
You’re high conviction.  When you commit to something, you're in all the way. You're opinionated, but you know when to disagree and commit. 
You’re comfortable when faced with a lot of ambiguity.  Both technically and organisationally. You’re happy to tackle problems without a clear definition or solution. It’s a startup! 
If you don’t meet all of these yet you should still seriously consider applying – we were all missing at least one of these at the outset! 
 
How we build... 
We think it’s more important to have the right mindset and ability to solve problems than to have exact experience with certain languages and tools, so don’t let that put you off applying — we often back hunger over experience. That being said, we know that you’ll want to know what technology you’ll be using on a daily basis so here’s the run down: 
Technologies: 
NextJS, React, React Hooks, ES6+, Material UI, TypeScript 
NodeJS, GraphQL, Hasura, Docker, Postgres Why Omnea? 
Meaningful upside.  We’ve stayed disciplined on valuation and amount raised and are giving early team members above market rate equity — we genuinely want this to feel like everyone’s business and for it to be life-changing for the early team. 
You’ll personally have a massive impact.  As part of the founding engineer team, you will have a direct and visible impact on the product&company. 
This market is huge & archaic.  We’re building in a space that hasn’t been properly disrupted in 20 years. Huge incumbents like Coupa, Oracle, SAP, Workday (their combined market cap is>$300bn) serve traditional, large companies but modern companies with between 300-5,000 employees have no good options, and so this opportunity is vast 
We’re serving the most exciting companies out there — they’re growing rapidly, fun to work with, and have an insanely high bar. Companies building for ‘old school businesses’ don’t build game-changing technology&we’ve intentionally avoided that trap 
And yes, we have all of the benefits you’d expect&more ... company-sponsored remote work opportunities abroad, flexible working, a ‘bring your own working policy’ type approach (we want to empower the best people to make their own decisions), random company days off, food, pets, etc.

Initial responsibility would be to work on our front -end library, which is in use across all TradingHub’s internal and external facing websites. This provides a reusable library of widgets (tables, graphs, layout components, etc) to allow our teams to rapidly build websites from reusable components. Responsibilities would cover the design of new features as well as maintenance/bugfixes. 
Our technology stack is highly innovative. We use C# in the front-end, which is transpiled to JavaScript at runtime. This allows our entire codebase (both server-side and client-side) to run from the same codebase, and is similar to Blazor in some ways. Our backend is a mix of classic relational databases, as well as a custom-designed NoSQL data store optimised for write once, read many operations. We also make heavy use of code generation to automate repetitive tasks. 
A successful candidate would spend most of their time working on the front-end and server-side components of our websites, and be comfortable enough to propose new approaches and ideas. The candidate will also be able to coordinate with internal teams who make use of our front-end library to prioritise new features, have a close relationship with our client support teams to prioritise fixes, and coordinate releases to client websites. 
 
Essential Skills/Competencies: 
Good understanding of the .NET stack, particularly C# 
Knowledge of any combination of html5/JavaScript/canvas/WebAssembly/Blazor/typescript/asm.js/Electron/CSS 
 
Ability to work independently 
Experience in financial services a bonus but not essential 
TradingHub is committed to providing equal opportunities and supporting diversity in employment. Diverse teams really are the best teams. 
 
Why should you apply? 
Ambition:  Extremely fast-growing company with an uncapped potential, offering every colleague a broad range of experience and plenty of opportunities for internal movement, as well as rapid career progression. Vibrant company culture full of uniquely talented and friendly colleagues with regular social perks to build camaraderie. 
Flexibility:  Flexible working policy (up to 3 days a week remote); 25 days holiday + bank holidays, informal dress code and excellent work/life balance. Generous maternity/parental leave policies. 
Reward:  Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus and discretionary EMI scheme (company share option scheme). 
Support:  Annual personal training budget, private healthcare, company pension plan, death in service coverage, cycle to work scheme & tech scheme.

Revmo is a new technology startup with a presence in the UK and the US. Our platform uses graph theory to help individuals and organisations make new connections by finding latent connections in their networks, their company’s networks to potential investors, customers or hires. 
Our stack includes JavaScript, React, Python, FastAPI, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Github Actions, and AWS but nothing is set in stone. For example, we’d like to phase out JavaScript in favour of TypeScript. We're finding new ways to improve things, driving our platform forward, faster. 
In this role, you should be able to work independently, with little supervision, to provide a mixture of mentoring and support to less experienced colleagues and contributions to the platform features, system design, and methodology. You should be able to communicate progress and challenges to your colleagues and our leadership; fostering collaboration and agility. 
You should believe in fast moving, small teams who achieve results through agile methodologies, collaboration, engineering skill, and pragmatism. We want you to help us to build an open, high-performing culture. 
 
About You 
You should have a strong software engineering background, preferably full-stack, with a wealth of experience to share around design patterns, cloud infrastructure, agile, and DevOps. 
This should be backed by relevant industry experience. 
You are comfortable building in Python and/or JavaScript (including TypeScript) 
You’ll know the entire development lifecycle in a web/cloud environment and software engineering best practices well, including cloud-native architecture, design, code, unit testing, integration testing, code review, and documentation. 
You thrive in a fast-paced environment that emphasises results over process and rapid iteration over planning. 
You’re keen to share your experience with less experienced team members, mentor them, and shape the future of the company. 
Be experienced in automated testing, ideally TDD but also BDD-style end-to-end tests.
 
 Benefits 
We’re still young and there’s plenty of opportunity to grow with the company as well as influencing the direction that the company takes. We offer a competitive early employee compensation package including equity. In addition, we offer a pension plan, private healthcare, and some flexible working.

On top of this, we use an in-house batch scheduler to execute jobs that run programs written in a proprietary functional relational language, which essentially power all our data analytics tools. Due to the complex nature of our batches, the scheduler contains many advanced features that have a lot in common with state-of-the-art orchestration engines (e.g. Ansible), and is one of our most widely used internal product: engineers and quant developers use it to analyze in depth the behavior of their scripts, and client-facing teams employ it to set up and monitor production batches. 
The scheduling software, currently in its second iteration, is made of a single mission control node and multiple agents installed on each machine in our cloud environment and would highly benefit from a series of improvements in terms of usability, batch structure, data normalization and introduction of new helpful features. Your role will be to design and develop a maintainable, robust and fail-safe system based on a modular and configurable job structure. 
 
About the role: 
This role will: 
Include intuitive monitoring and scheduling interfaces 
Provide efficient ways for both engineers and non-technical users to interact with the scheduler 
Support core and advanced features such as: variable overrides, task loops, conditional execution, privileges and permissions, intelligent error-handling 
This will involve exposure to the full development stack as you will need to understand business and technical requirements and translate them into deliverables, working with both backend and frontend components; you will also be responsible for writing automated tests and proper documentation. 
You do not need to be an expert in all aspects mentioned above, but it is essential that you have a strong desire to constantly learn, and to develop and own a critical software project upon which production systems will depend: we think this will be very interesting for someone passionate about working across the full software stack to build meaningful applications. 
Extended experience with programming is a must, ideally in C# but this is not necessarily required, since the tooling you will be using is likely so different to anything you have used before. We are *NOT* looking for someone who only cares about the superficial aspects of interfacing with a codebase, rather someone who really understands how the internals work and generally has a passion for finding out things *really* work under the hood (be that any subject, such as governance, business or computer science). Free thinking and independence are also required, but as are being realistic about deadlines and commitments. 
 
Requirements: 
Experience of object oriented programming (C++, C#, Java etc.) 
STEM degree OR relevant industry experience within a programming position 
Flexibility to work in a fast-paced environment, often utilising proprietary methods 
Comfortable working in a team 
(Desirable) Experience working with provisioning, batch scheduling or configuration management tools 
Why should you apply? 
Ambition:  Extremely fast-growing company with an uncapped potential, offering every colleague a broad range of experience and plenty of opportunities for internal movement, as well as rapid career progression. Vibrant company culture full of uniquely talented and friendly colleagues with regular social perks to build camaraderie. 
Flexibility:  Flexible working policy (up to 3 days a week remote); 25 days holiday + bank holidays, informal dress code and excellent work/life balance. Generous maternity/parental leave policies. 
Reward:  Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus and discretionary EMI scheme (company share option scheme). 
Support:  Annual personal training budget, private healthcare, company pension plan, death in service coverage, cycle to work scheme & tech scheme.

Some of the areas you may be working on: Our sensitive data and classification engine, building systems to allow us to process billions of messages a day, data ingest pipelines, sensitive data remediation system, risk identification and ranking engines and alerting systems. 
Our backend services are in Typescript (with GraphQL + Postgres) and front-end in React/TypeScript. We use AWS ECS Fargate via github actions and Terraform to deploy to production multiple times a day.
 
 Requirements 
Who we're looking for: 
Product-minded and pragmatic engineers - Front of mind for you is thinking through what the best solution is for the problem the customer is facing. You’ll be given a lot of autonomy to explore solutions from what we build, how it’s designed and what technologies we use. 
Problem-solvers - We’re facing a lot of previously uncharted territory and with that a set of new and unseen challenges. You’re not one to shy away from tackling these sorts of problems. 
One eye on now, one eye on what’s next - Our engineers have a passion for bringing to life distributed systems and scalable and robust architectures. You’ll have a huge role in coming up with how the system will evolve from an architecture and engineering standpoint. 
Culture contributors - We’re a small, close-knit team and recognise the importance of our culture as we continue to grow. You’ll be pivotal in helping shape the early stages and building a team platform that we can grow from. 
Hybrid Working - We’re remote friendly and also have an office in Shoreditch, London, for those who prefer that. We trust you’ll find a work arrangement that works for you. 
Private Health Insurance - Enrolled from Day 1 through Vitality, for when life happens. 
Holiday Leave - 25 days holiday leave, excluding bank holidays. 
Learning Budget - £400 per year to invest in your growth 
WFH Budget - £150 per year to contribute to your home office 
Friendly & Social Team - We have regular team socials both in-person and online, including an annual team trip away (previous years have been in the South of France and Lisbon). 
Working Environment - We’re a small, friendly and close-knit team who value kindness, transparency and autonomy to have an impact 
We also recognise our success is your success, so you’ll receive tax-efficient EMI stock options as part of our annual grant process. 
 
Our recruitment process 
We know your time is important and want to make sure our recruitment process provides both of us a really authentic and meaningful insight into what it would be like working together, so we’re planning on the following stages: 
Intro Call (30 mins) - This will focus on your motivations and interests, your journey to date and some of the experiences you’ve had, along with a chance to share more about Metomic and the Engineering Team. 
Technical Test (max 2 hours) - Instructions will be provided and this should not take any longer than 2 hours. 
Technical Interview (1.5 hours) - Part 1 will involve a technical discussion and Part 2 a whiteboard systems design activity. 
Meet the team (30 mins - 1 hour) - Optional depending on how many of your future colleagues you'll have met during the recruitment steps so far.

Limejump is a technology platform that manages a large renewable energy network. Our portfolio delivers clean energy to businesses and homes, using renewables and stored energy when it’s needed to meet demand. 
We connect and manage 100% renewable energy through the intelligent control of renewable generators, such as wind turbines and solar panels. We work closely with renewable asset owners, buying their energy and then selling it onto the UK’s grid, giving them simple access to the power market. But, the sun isn’t always shining and the wind isn’t always blowing. We must therefore capture energy for times when there is high demand. By harnessing big data and renewable technology, we accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.
 About the role: 
Limejump seeks a software engineer to help us change the world of energy. We’re looking for someone excited about both green energy and software development to help tackle our reconciliation engine, a core piece of our platform strategy that ingests, curates, and exposes accurate time series data that’s used to drive billing, trading and our data science. 
The data is delivered in real-time, across hundreds of data sources in minute-level blocks, compiled against different customers with different processes, and combined with the complex nature of the energy industry in the UK and abroad. It’s quite the engineering challenge, and we could use some help. 
Your contribution would be more than just code: our team develops its architecture by consensus, so you’d be informing design decisions from day one. We also have a culture of mentorship across the company, so you’d be expected to help others in advancing your skills while also having the opportunity to learn from engineers more experienced than yourself. 
 
Essential Requirements: 
3+ years back-end software development experience, some of which with Python 
Experience working with relational databases, e.g. PostgreSQL 
An open and collaborative attitude with a desire to help others 
A passion for Limejump’s vision of a sustainable future, and a commitment to our values

 Desirable Experience: 
Experience with Django 
ETL/workflow automation experience 
Understanding of container-based architecture – Docker and/or Kubernetes 
Experience with time series databases 
Energy/Fintech industry experience 
 
£1k annual innovation budget to spend on self development coupled with 10% time off work to do it 
Private Medical Insurance with AXA PPP with £0 annual excess 
25 days annual leave…and one extra day for your birthday 
Flexible working options to suit your personal life (including caring responsibility and/or your cultural background) 
Mental wellbeing support with Mental Health First Aiders and Employee Assistance Programme 
Company wide lunch n learns, culturally diverse celebrations and other social events 
Parental leave – up to 12 weeks paid maternity, adoption and shared parental leave 
Subsidised onsite gym membership and weekly fitness classes 
Cycle to Work Scheme – enjoy a carbon free commute on us! 
Life assurance and personal accident insurance 
Other perks and Culture 
In addition to the listed benefits above, day-to-day life at Limejump is packed full of perks. There is flexibility to split your working week between home and office as well as flexible working hours to allow for balancing work with personal responsibility and circumstances. In the office we have ample comfortable breakout and booth spaces to promote a collaborative working environment. We have a pool table, regularly stocked snacks and drinks, casual working attire and the option to occasionally bring your best fur friend into work with you. 
On top of this we have regular company, department, and team socials to bond with colleagues outside of day-to-day work. Some examples of social and knowledge sharing events include our Summer and end of year party, Stress Awareness Month, Ramadan and World Pizza Day.

Only 15% of electronics end up being recycled and an even higher percentage are left unused. These symbols of our progression as a society are responsible for our rapid environmental decay. We're here to change that. 
We build software for electronics companies who are operating producer owned models: that's when a company owns, looks after and ultimately recycles it's products. Charging it's customers to access them. Like an e-scooter sharing platform or a robotics as-a-service business. Which are are not only climate compatible but also brilliant user centric business models. 
Our platform solves for two problems that prevent companies from making the switch to this model. Digitising the new operations they will need, now they are the custodians of their products lifecycle. And accessing capital to help smooth out the longer payback periods these models have. 
We're building a set of tools and integrations that lets producers manage the lifecycles of their products. We quantify the economic and environmental impact of their products lifecycle. Using this data to give producers instant access to their products future earnings, to help them with working and growth capital. This same data creates a detailed green financial product for our lenders.
 About the role: 
We are looking for a senior software engineer to come onboard and join our growing product team, with a particular focus on our React frontend software. If you are an engineer who loves to build beautiful and user friendly interfaces, solve exciting problems and make data come alive, we would love to chat to you! 
We know that no single discipline has all the answers needed to design out waste and grow hardware services, and we've found that the best new ideas come from dedicated collaboration between different fields. We firmly believe that to do that well, we need to build a diverse, empowered and cross-functional team.
 Responsibilities: 
You will be responsible for the front end experience of our products, primarily the lifecycle platform, a NextJS Typescript React application 
You will be involved in every part of solving problems for our customers, from product to business to technology decisions being made 
You will be part of a growing product & engineering team using the latest technologies and frameworks for delivering great software 
You will help and influence the culture, not just in the product team but in the business overall 
Implementing many small views over a single set of data 
Architecting a multi-tenant white-labelled SaaS with isolated data and access controls 
Spinning up new experiment prototype services very rapidly for customers in the pilots 
Integrating with multiple third party services on the backend, and building architecture to support pluggable APIs 
Quickly building polished front-ends to support different feature experiments
 Requirements: 
You will have built and launched products using React and Typescript, functioning at architect or senior level 
You're deeply experienced in the frontend, but also comfortable working in the backend (writing Typescript business logic and API routes) 
We are going to visualise a fair deal of data so experience with visualisation & charting libraries would be great! 
You understand the importance of testing front-end components, utilising unit, integration and end-to-end testing models (Jest/Cypress) and continuous integration and deployment workflows 
You can demonstrate knowledge of front-end system design, interaction with backend APIs, and performance/security considerations 
You understand common UX patterns and are able to identify and mitigate UX design risks early in the development process 
Taking care of yourself 
Health and happiness  - We want to support our employees health and happiness. Everyone's version of that is different so we're trusting you to spend your £100 per month allowance on what makes sense for you. 
Time off  - We don’t have set holiday days. We trust you to act in the best interest of the company, to us that means being well rested. We want you to have control and be able to observe what’s important to you — including taking time off when your mind and body need a break. Some people need a bit more of a push when it comes to taking holiday so your manager will make sure you take at least 25 days off a year and generally gloat about their latest hiking trip. 
Doing your best work 
Working together  - We are working in a hybrid model where we have set days in the office and on the other days you can work where you want to. Right now we're loving having set time to workshop and collaborate, where we make sure the intensity is high. 
Diversity matters  - We know that no single discipline has all the answers needed to help us realise the economic and environmental benefits of our vision. We’ve found that the best ideas come from dedicated collaboration between different fields. We firmly believe that to do that well, we need to build a diverse, empowered and cross functional team.
 High performance environment  - We have a real dedication to our mission. We know for us to realise it, that we need to push each other to do our best work. This means supporting and motivating each other to be braver and communicating clearly how we can each improve. 
Trust  - We value flat hierarchies, clear communication full ownership and responsibility. We want you to bring forward anything that you think will help us be a better business. To feel empowered to make big bets that can have a major impact and be comfortable to shine a light on your mistakes if it doesn't come off.

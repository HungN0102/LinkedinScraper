At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Apollo, or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. 
As a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties. 
SWE principles include: 
 
 Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems. Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team. 
Technologies We Use 
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use: 
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github 
What We Value 
Engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience coding in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Ability to communicate and collaborate with a variety of individuals, including engineers, users and non-technical team members. 
Willingness to learn and make decisions independently, and the ability to ask questions when stuck. 
Valued but not required: Active US Security clearance or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance. 
To apply, please submit the following: 
An updated resume / CV 
Thoughtful responses to our application questions 
Offer Deadline 
In an effort to build more transparency into our recruitment process, we’d like to share our offer deadline expectations. By applying to this position, you commit to confirming your decision within two weeks of receiving your written offer. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location. 
Requirements 
Security clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. 
Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. 
Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points. 
It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use: 
A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github 
Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them. 
Demonstrated ability to learn and work independently and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
A desire to work on software that can change the world and a passion for creating intuitive, scalable products that augment our users' ability to work with data. 
Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance is beneficial but not necessary. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

Front-end 
You’ll implement our designs to craft an amazing SaaS experience. You’ll go the extra mile to ensure Omnea is pixel perfect and represents a best-in-class user experience. 
You’ll ensure our platform stays responsive and looking sharp across different resolutions, different platforms and meets all our accessibility targets.  Backend 
You’ll build our data integration systems from scratch, learning by doing. You’ll take concepts and PoC’s from design to production. You’ll work with our integration partners to design how we communicate with their systems and data. You’ll craft our REST APIs and micro-services taking into account our security and compliance obligations. 
 
What can you expect? 
Engineering 
You’ll build a beautiful SaaS application using JavaScript/Typescript from scratch to deploy to tens of thousands of users in a matter of months. You’ll need to write a lot of code and get your hands dirty in plenty of engineering challenges. You’ll write resilient software that can handle hundreds of thousands of users.  Culture 
You’ll participate in the “startup” hustle of getting features shipped quickly following agile best practices alongside a committed team. You’ll take part in coding reviews, up-skilling new employees and pair programming to diagnose issues. ️ Product 
You’ll implement features that have direct impact and add value to our customers. You’ll work closely with the founders to implement the vision of Omnea. 
 
About you 
You’re experienced (3+ years)  with building beautiful web apps having designed and implemented features from start to finish using JavaScript or Typescript. 
You’re ready to learn.  You want to absorb everything there is about building enterprise-grade software and improve your capabilities as a software engineer. You want to understand what it takes to build something from scratch to scale. 
You’re product-minded.  You have a sense for a great user experience and feel for when something is off. You find fulfilment in building beautiful products that people actually love to use. 
You want to take ownership.  You feel it’s your time to take ownership of the features you develop and deliver them to a standard you know you are able to. 
You’re ready to get a lot done.  You have a bias to action and want to accelerate your engineering career rapidly. 
You’re entrepreneurially-minded.  You are excited about the opportunity of joining as an early member of the engineering team and taking something from 0 to 1. You know it’s going to take hard work and lots of learning but you are ready to take it on. 
You’re a  team builder.  You make the team around you stronger. You’re happy to take the extra time to explain things, provide actionable feedback, and level up those around you. 
You’re high conviction.  When you commit to something, you're in all the way. You're opinionated, but you know when to disagree and commit. 
You’re comfortable when faced with a lot of ambiguity.  Both technically and organisationally. You’re happy to tackle problems without a clear definition or solution. It’s a startup! 
If you don’t meet all of these yet you should still seriously consider applying – we were all missing at least one of these at the outset! 
 
How we build... 
We think it’s more important to have the right mindset and ability to solve problems than to have exact experience with certain languages and tools, so don’t let that put you off applying — we often back hunger over experience. That being said, we know that you’ll want to know what technology you’ll be using on a daily basis so here’s the run down: 
Technologies: 
NextJS, React, React Hooks, ES6+, Material UI, TypeScript 
NodeJS, GraphQL, Hasura, Docker, Postgres Why Omnea? 
Meaningful upside.  We’ve stayed disciplined on valuation and amount raised and are giving early team members above market rate equity — we genuinely want this to feel like everyone’s business and for it to be life-changing for the early team. 
You’ll personally have a massive impact.  As part of the founding engineer team, you will have a direct and visible impact on the product&company. 
This market is huge & archaic.  We’re building in a space that hasn’t been properly disrupted in 20 years. Huge incumbents like Coupa, Oracle, SAP, Workday (their combined market cap is>$300bn) serve traditional, large companies but modern companies with between 300-5,000 employees have no good options, and so this opportunity is vast 
We’re serving the most exciting companies out there — they’re growing rapidly, fun to work with, and have an insanely high bar. Companies building for ‘old school businesses’ don’t build game-changing technology&we’ve intentionally avoided that trap 
And yes, we have all of the benefits you’d expect&more ... company-sponsored remote work opportunities abroad, flexible working, a ‘bring your own working policy’ type approach (we want to empower the best people to make their own decisions), random company days off, food, pets, etc.

At Palantir, we're passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use their data. Our technology has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir's platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you'll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You'll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world's most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you'll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
Our Principles
 Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. 
The Role 
The Privacy and Civil Liberties (PCL) team is a mission-driven interdisciplinary team of Software Engineers, Product Designers, Lawyers, and Applied Ethicists. The goal of the PCL team is to design, build, and deploy privacy and civil liberties protective technologies, and to foster a culture of responsibility around their development and use. Our team successfully manages multiple internal and external commitments simultaneously while navigating complex and nuanced political environments with care.

As a Software Engineer on the Privacy and Civil Liberties (PCL) team, you will join a team responsible for designing and building world-leading software that enables Palantir and its customers to meet legal requirements and ethical obligations while achieving mission-critical outcomes. We manage our own suite of privacy enhancing technologies as well as collaborate closely with product teams to ensure privacy considerations are integrated at all levels of Palantir platforms. We also engage externally with customers and academia to ensure we remain engaged in solving cutting edge privacy issues. In this role, you will need to understand and stay up to date on rapidly changing socio-technical environments, and developing actionable technical solutions. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, or Data Science. 
Ability to design, implement, and scale intuitive privacy-enhancing products for diverse user groups. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, front-end frameworks, and/or other technical tools 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Experience in any of the following domains a plus: security, machine learning techniques, machine learning driven applications, machine learning infrastructure and/or internet of things

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
 
 Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value
 Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location.

Initial responsibility would be to work on our front -end library, which is in use across all TradingHub’s internal and external facing websites. This provides a reusable library of widgets (tables, graphs, layout components, etc) to allow our teams to rapidly build websites from reusable components. Responsibilities would cover the design of new features as well as maintenance/bugfixes. 
Our technology stack is highly innovative. We use C# in the front-end, which is transpiled to JavaScript at runtime.

Our backend is a mix of classic relational databases, as well as a custom-designed NoSQL data store optimised for write once, read many operations. We also make heavy use of code generation to automate repetitive tasks. 
A successful candidate would spend most of their time working on the front-end and server-side components of our websites, and be comfortable enough to propose new approaches and ideas. The candidate will also be able to coordinate with internal teams who make use of our front-end library to prioritise new features, have a close relationship with our client support teams to prioritise fixes, and coordinate releases to client websites. 
 
Essential Skills/Competencies: 
Good understanding of the .NET stack, particularly C# 
Knowledge of any combination of html5/JavaScript/canvas/WebAssembly/Blazor/typescript/asm.js/Electron/CSS 
 
Ability to work independently 
Experience in financial services a bonus but not essential 
TradingHub is committed to providing equal opportunities and supporting diversity in employment. Diverse teams really are the best teams. 
 
Why should you apply?

At Palantir, we’re driven to solve the world's most critical and challenging problems, and believe that building software to enable human decision making is the most effective vector. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. 
The Role 
The Privacy and Civil Liberties (PCL) team is a mission-driven interdisciplinary team of Software Engineers, Product Designers, Lawyers, and Applied Ethicists. The goal of the PCL team is to design, build, and deploy privacy and civil liberties protective technologies, and to foster a culture of responsibility around their development and use. Our team successfully manages multiple internal and external commitments simultaneously while navigating complex and nuanced political environments with care. We have deep expertise in privacy law and technology ethics, and are able to translate legal and ethical requirements into practical technical products. 
As a Software Engineer on the Privacy and Civil Liberties (PCL) team, you will join a team responsible for designing and building world-leading software that enables Palantir and its customers to meet legal requirements and ethical obligations while achieving mission-critical outcomes. We manage our own suite of privacy enhancing technologies as well as collaborate closely with product teams to ensure privacy considerations are integrated at all levels of Palantir platforms. We also engage externally with customers and academia to ensure we remain engaged in solving cutting edge privacy issues. In this role, you will need to understand and stay up to date on rapidly changing socio-technical environments, and developing actionable technical solutions. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, or Data Science. 
Ability to design, implement, and scale intuitive privacy-enhancing products for diverse user groups. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, front-end frameworks, and/or other technical tools 
Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Ability to collaborate and empathize with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Experience in any of the following domains a plus: security, machine learning techniques, machine learning driven applications, machine learning infrastructure and/or internet of things

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 
 
 As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 
 
 Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop. 
Our Principles 
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. 
Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. 
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. 
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves. 
Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge. 
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers. 
What We Value 
Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science. 
A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems. 
Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. 
Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location. 
Requirements 
Security clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us. 
The Role 
We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems. 
The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration. 
You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level. 
Technologies We Use 
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. 
TypeScript and React are central to our front-end development. 
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library. 
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand. 
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub. 
What We Value 
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work. 
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems. 
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. 
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. 
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building. 
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. 
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. 
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. 
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. 
Palantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world’s hardest problems. 
Palantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help."

 Engineering track 
Developing sophisticated software to better the world. The software engineer's role is to engineer the delivery of working software that meets our client's needs. 
Sounds fancy, right? As a Software Engineer at Entelect you are responsible for more than just writing code. You will find that the process, environment, tooling and even maturity of the client’s software knowledge varies across the teams, so the Software Engineer’s job would vary too, depending on the situation.

You will find that as you transition through different projects, teams, domains and clients, you will always be learning - and that’s part of what makes working at Entelect cool. 
 
About the role 
If you are at this point in your career, it means that you have experience, you are working fairly independently and are probably becoming everyone's ‘go-to guy’. As an Intermediate you are expected to be skilled enough that you can assist other Software Engineers. You have a good sense of things like coding principles, stakeholder engagement and you are a damn good trouble-shooter because you understand how systems fit together, and when and who to ask for help. At this point in your career, you should also be able to architect basic components of a system. 
 
Our UK business is just getting started, so you'll have an opportunity to shape our identity as we grow. We have big ambitions and the support from our hugely successful South African business. 
Our UK package includes: 
Hybrid work arrangement

Life assurance and income protection

With a variety of projects using an array of technologies across various business domains, you can find work that suits you. 
 
Team-based projects 
All our projects are team-based, so you're always with other experienced people who will show you best practices and involve you in finding new and innovative ways to do things. 
 
Work with like-minded people 
Fellowship is forged with people who care about you, their craft and the hobbies you share. 
 
Tech company run by tech people 
We’re an ambitious, growing organisation without the usual nonsense and politics. 
 
Autonomy and identity 
We function as a tribe of tribes, so there’s plenty of autonomy and scope to create a different identity for each project and team.

We’ve grown into 3 continents and we’re always looking for awesome devs, analysts, UX gurus, data engineers and scientists, architects, leaders, and more.

Limejump is a technology platform that manages a large renewable energy network. Our portfolio delivers clean energy to businesses and homes, using renewables and stored energy when it’s needed to meet demand. 
We connect and manage 100% renewable energy through the intelligent control of renewable generators, such as wind turbines and solar panels. We work closely with renewable asset owners, buying their energy and then selling it onto the UK’s grid, giving them simple access to the power market. But, the sun isn’t always shining and the wind isn’t always blowing. We must therefore capture energy for times when there is high demand. By harnessing big data and renewable technology, we accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.
 About the role: 
Limejump seeks a software engineer to help us change the world of energy. We’re looking for someone excited about both green energy and software development to help tackle our reconciliation engine, a core piece of our platform strategy that ingests, curates, and exposes accurate time series data that’s used to drive billing, trading and our data science. 
The data is delivered in real-time, across hundreds of data sources in minute-level blocks, compiled against different customers with different processes, and combined with the complex nature of the energy industry in the UK and abroad. It’s quite the engineering challenge, and we could use some help. 
Your contribution would be more than just code: our team develops its architecture by consensus, so you’d be informing design decisions from day one. We also have a culture of mentorship across the company, so you’d be expected to help others in advancing your skills while also having the opportunity to learn from engineers more experienced than yourself. 
 
Essential Requirements: 
3+ years back-end software development experience, some of which with Python 
Experience working with relational databases, e.g. PostgreSQL 
An open and collaborative attitude with a desire to help others 
A passion for Limejump’s vision of a sustainable future, and a commitment to our values 
Knowledge of standard methodologies and best practices in software development: CI/CD, object-oriented design
 
 Desirable Experience: 
Experience with Django 
ETL/workflow automation experience 
Understanding of container-based architecture – Docker and/or Kubernetes 
Experience with time series databases 
Energy/Fintech industry experience 
 
£1k annual innovation budget to spend on self development coupled with 10% time off work to do it 
Private Medical Insurance with AXA PPP with £0 annual excess 
25 days annual leave…and one extra day for your birthday 
Flexible working options to suit your personal life (including caring responsibility and/or your cultural background) 
Mental wellbeing support with Mental Health First Aiders and Employee Assistance Programme 
Company wide lunch n learns, culturally diverse celebrations and other social events 
Parental leave – up to 12 weeks paid maternity, adoption and shared parental leave 
Subsidised onsite gym membership and weekly fitness classes 
Cycle to Work Scheme – enjoy a carbon free commute on us! 
Life assurance and personal accident insurance 
Other perks and Culture 
In addition to the listed benefits above, day-to-day life at Limejump is packed full of perks. There is flexibility to split your working week between home and office as well as flexible working hours to allow for balancing work with personal responsibility and circumstances. In the office we have ample comfortable breakout and booth spaces to promote a collaborative working environment. We have a pool table, regularly stocked snacks and drinks, casual working attire and the option to occasionally bring your best fur friend into work with you. 
On top of this we have regular company, department, and team socials to bond with colleagues outside of day-to-day work. Some examples of social and knowledge sharing events include our Summer and end of year party, Stress Awareness Month, Ramadan and World Pizza Day.

Only 15% of electronics end up being recycled and an even higher percentage are left unused. These symbols of our progression as a society are responsible for our rapid environmental decay. We're here to change that. 
We build software for electronics companies who are operating producer owned models: that's when a company owns, looks after and ultimately recycles it's products. Charging it's customers to access them. Like an e-scooter sharing platform or a robotics as-a-service business. Which are are not only climate compatible but also brilliant user centric business models. 
Our platform solves for two problems that prevent companies from making the switch to this model. Digitising the new operations they will need, now they are the custodians of their products lifecycle. And accessing capital to help smooth out the longer payback periods these models have. 
We're building a set of tools and integrations that lets producers manage the lifecycles of their products. We quantify the economic and environmental impact of their products lifecycle. Using this data to give producers instant access to their products future earnings, to help them with working and growth capital. This same data creates a detailed green financial product for our lenders.
 About the role: 
We are looking for a senior software engineer to come onboard and join our growing product team, with a particular focus on our React frontend software. If you are an engineer who loves to build beautiful and user friendly interfaces, solve exciting problems and make data come alive, we would love to chat to you! 
We know that no single discipline has all the answers needed to design out waste and grow hardware services, and we've found that the best new ideas come from dedicated collaboration between different fields. We firmly believe that to do that well, we need to build a diverse, empowered and cross-functional team.
 Responsibilities: 
You will be responsible for the front end experience of our products, primarily the lifecycle platform, a NextJS Typescript React application 
You will be involved in every part of solving problems for our customers, from product to business to technology decisions being made 
You will be part of a growing product & engineering team using the latest technologies and frameworks for delivering great software 
You will help and influence the culture, not just in the product team but in the business overall 
Implementing many small views over a single set of data 
Architecting a multi-tenant white-labelled SaaS with isolated data and access controls 
Spinning up new experiment prototype services very rapidly for customers in the pilots 
Integrating with multiple third party services on the backend, and building architecture to support pluggable APIs 
Quickly building polished front-ends to support different feature experiments
 Requirements: 
You will have built and launched products using React and Typescript, functioning at architect or senior level 
You're deeply experienced in the frontend, but also comfortable working in the backend (writing Typescript business logic and API routes) 
We are going to visualise a fair deal of data so experience with visualisation & charting libraries would be great! 
You understand the importance of testing front-end components, utilising unit, integration and end-to-end testing models (Jest/Cypress) and continuous integration and deployment workflows 
You can demonstrate knowledge of front-end system design, interaction with backend APIs, and performance/security considerations 
You understand common UX patterns and are able to identify and mitigate UX design risks early in the development process 
Taking care of yourself 
Health and happiness  - We want to support our employees health and happiness. Everyone's version of that is different so we're trusting you to spend your £100 per month allowance on what makes sense for you. 
Time off  - We don’t have set holiday days. We trust you to act in the best interest of the company, to us that means being well rested. We want you to have control and be able to observe what’s important to you — including taking time off when your mind and body need a break. Some people need a bit more of a push when it comes to taking holiday so your manager will make sure you take at least 25 days off a year and generally gloat about their latest hiking trip. 
Doing your best work 
Working together  - We are working in a hybrid model where we have set days in the office and on the other days you can work where you want to. Right now we're loving having set time to workshop and collaborate, where we make sure the intensity is high. 
Diversity matters  - We know that no single discipline has all the answers needed to help us realise the economic and environmental benefits of our vision. We’ve found that the best ideas come from dedicated collaboration between different fields. We firmly believe that to do that well, we need to build a diverse, empowered and cross functional team.
 High performance environment  - We have a real dedication to our mission. We know for us to realise it, that we need to push each other to do our best work. This means supporting and motivating each other to be braver and communicating clearly how we can each improve. 
Trust  - We value flat hierarchies, clear communication full ownership and responsibility. We want you to bring forward anything that you think will help us be a better business. To feel empowered to make big bets that can have a major impact and be comfortable to shine a light on your mistakes if it doesn't come off.

About the role: 
Our teams are growing rapidly and we’re hiring a Software Engineer to take our products to the next level of scale.

You will focus on having the highest impact on the product 
You will join one of our product teams as an owner of one of our products, these include AwesomeAds, Kids Web Services, PopJam and Rukkaz, as well as internal facing teams. 
You will have your say in the product roadmap and help the team and the Product Manager to make the most informed decisions to break down complex tech deliverables into simple and understandable user stories. 
Quality is key for us, so you will ensure all product components are built to an appropriate level of quality for the stage (alpha/beta/production), deliver products using the appropriate level of testing and monitoring, fail fast, and learn and iterate frequently. You will champion continuous improvement and always aim to improve the product your team owns and measure your impact with the appropriate tech, product, or delivery metrics. 
 
Responsibilities: 
You’ll work across the full stack depending on where you can drive the highest impact: back-end, front-end as well as testing and cloud infrastructure 
You’ll work with your team to design and implement features and services for the product your team owns, and keep the design choices well documented and explained 
You will master one or more domains and will break complex goals into simple and iterative deliverables 
Commit to high-speed iterations, high code quality, and continuous improvement via agile processes

In short, please apply if you are interested in working with our stack! As soon as you join you will have an on-boarding plan tailored to you, challenging and bringing you up to speed. 
We’ll ask you about your previous experiences building large and complex high-throughput web systems, and we’ll hear the stories you’ll be willing to share about microservices, event-driven architectures, databases, or any tech challenge you’ve enjoyed. 
We’ll want to know how you went about improving the quality, security, scalability, and observability of the products you worked on, and how you would try to repeat that success at SuperAwesome. 
DevOps practices are an integral part of our culture, and we’ll want to hear what aspect of them you prefer, and what worked well for you out of the box, or how you adapted them to your needs. 
In a nutshell, we’re looking for a great engineer, and we’ll do our best to identify the greatness in you ❤️ 
About you as a person: 
You think about things critically - we’re the first to do what we do in this industry, so you’ll come across new problems every day 
You’ll fearlessly attack problems - we think the tools you know now are secondary to having the mindset to fix things, i.e. you’re a problem solver and not just a builder 
You like working in a team - we have an agile development environment and get stuff done together in multi-disciplinary teams 
You’re flexible and adaptable - we have multiple teams working on complementary but different products, so you’ll thrive on variety

Over 150 million people use the Lyst app and website each year to shop an assortment of 8 million items via a highly personalised experience. Lyst is a scale-up environment, combining an agile mentality with a proven business model and over a decade of experience. This provides a balance between foundations and structure, and autonomy and pace. Our goal is to be the category leading destination which every fashion shopper uses to decide what to buy. 
Data and technology sit at the heart of everything we do, and we firmly believe that we can only meet our goals by prioritising our team and culture. We give our people the freedom to drive impact and shape the future of our company, within a diverse, inclusive and high-trust environment. We don’t rely on prescriptive rules, policies and procedures to drive results. We trust the judgement and ownership of our team, and prioritise learning and career development, knowing that our success is only possible thanks to our people. Lyst was founded in London in 2010, and has raised over $160m from leading investors including Accel, Balderton, Draper Esprit, Fidelity International, and LVMH. 
We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to come and join our team, to help us build upon and improve our systems that help connect our customers who love fashion with the world’s top fashion brands. 
 
About the team: 
We maintain about half a dozen services with a team of software & machine learning engineers, data scientists and our product manager. 
We care about collecting metrics and properly monitoring our services. 
We work mostly in Python3. 
We use Docker and Kubernetes for managing our services in production. 
We use AWS Step Functions and Metaflow for managing our Data Science models. 
We use CircleCI for continuous integration and moved a lot of our services to be continuously deployed too, which is exciting! 
We work closely with other teams across tribes, and almost all of Lyst engineering uses our services. 
As a Senior Software Engineer on the Search & Rank team at Lyst, you’ll be working on one of the main teams responsible for making connections between products and our customers. We solve some unique problems at Lyst, and with the largest data catalog of fashion products you’ll be learning the best solutions as you go. We aim to build software that’s easy to maintain and low on surprises, which is a goal in many of the design approaches we’ve taken. You’ll have the opportunity for impact by building and maintaining some of the core services at Lyst. You'll be working on productionising solutions to problems involving named entity recognition, search result ranking & diversification, personalisation and recommender systems.

We make great use of both the Python and AWS data science ecosystems to power our solutions. Familiarity with Django, REST interfaces, ElasticSearch, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas and related tools would be helpful. 
If you’ve programmed in a different language and not worked with Python before, that’s OK, knowing how to code is a transferable skill. Equally if you’ve never used AWS before and have experience with an alternative cloud provider, that’s OK too. There’s time to learn on the job and a supportive, knowledgeable team will help you. We believe in having a curious mindset and your ability to learn to do the job is more important than a checklist of must haves.

Over 150 million people use the Lyst app and website each year to shop an assortment of 8 million items via a highly personalised experience. Lyst is a scale-up environment, combining an agile mentality with a proven business model and over a decade of experience. This provides a balance between foundations and structure, and autonomy and pace. Our goal is to be the category leading destination which every fashion shopper uses to decide what to buy. 
Data and technology sit at the heart of everything we do, and we firmly believe that we can only meet our goals by prioritising our team and culture. We give our people the freedom to drive impact and shape the future of our company, within a diverse, inclusive and high-trust environment. We don’t rely on prescriptive rules, policies and procedures to drive results. We trust the judgement and ownership of our team, and prioritise learning and career development, knowing that our success is only possible thanks to our people. Lyst was founded in London in 2010, and has raised over $160m from leading investors including Accel, Balderton, Draper Esprit, Fidelity International, and LVMH. 
We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to come and join our team, to help us build upon and improve our systems that help connect our customers who love fashion with the world’s top fashion brands. 
 
About the team: 
We maintain about half a dozen services with a team of software & machine learning engineers, data scientists and our product manager. 
We care about collecting metrics and properly monitoring our services. 
We work mostly in Python3. 
We use Docker and Kubernetes for managing our services in production. 
We use AWS Step Functions and Metaflow for managing our Data Science models. 
We use CircleCI for continuous integration and moved a lot of our services to be continuously deployed too, which is exciting! 
We work closely with other teams across tribes, and almost all of Lyst engineering uses our services. 
As a Senior Software Engineer on the Search & Rank team at Lyst, you’ll be working on one of the main teams responsible for making connections between products and our customers. We solve some unique problems at Lyst, and with the largest data catalog of fashion products you’ll be learning the best solutions as you go. We aim to build software that’s easy to maintain and low on surprises, which is a goal in many of the design approaches we’ve taken. You’ll have the opportunity for impact by building and maintaining some of the core services at Lyst. You'll be working on productionising solutions to problems involving named entity recognition, search result ranking & diversification, personalisation and recommender systems. 
 
Requirements: 
Experience with building and maintaining microservices 
Ready to contribute to an inclusive and positive working environment for everyone 
Able to communicate clearly and be humble when sharing ideas with everyone on the team 
Previous experience with data science, or an active interest in it, is a plus 
Capable of writing production quality code and doing iterative development, balancing speed to ship and long term maintainability 
Experience with the creation and maintenance of ETL pipelines is a plus 
Have a detail oriented mindset and actively demonstrate curiosity 
We make great use of both the Python and AWS data science ecosystems to power our solutions. Familiarity with Django, REST interfaces, ElasticSearch, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas and related tools would be helpful. 
If you’ve programmed in a different language and not worked with Python before, that’s OK, knowing how to code is a transferable skill. Equally if you’ve never used AWS before and have experience with an alternative cloud provider, that’s OK too. There’s time to learn on the job and a supportive, knowledgeable team will help you. We believe in having a curious mindset and your ability to learn to do the job is more important than a checklist of must haves. 
You get 29 days' time off throughout the year to take a well earned rest, in addition to the 8 public bank holidays

We leverage our proprietary expertise in financial technology to identify, unlock and accelerate value for our portfolio companies and partners. We believe deeply in the power of technology to transform businesses and industries. Utilising our broad market connectivity and market leading technology capabilities we aim to be at the forefront of innovation as it emerges, delivering new capabilities into the hands of our portfolio and partners. 
Motive Create is structured across three centres of excellence: 
Services – Experts in executing due diligence, value creation planning and portfolio value creation execution 
Propositions – Drive innovation for our portfolio and partners 
Product – Build new technology assets and platforms that underpin our value creation and innovation activities 
We are currently recruiting Backend Software Engineers across two different Product teams:  Spoke  and  Sense . 
 
About the Product Teams: 
Spoke Marketplace  is forming the future of how marketplaces are used by the finance industry, and it requires passionate and creative product-centric engineers to support this effort. Our vision is to allow everyone and anyone to gain access to the products and services they need, through any channel. 
We believe that companies will move to having a marketplace business model, where they can offer both their own products and services as well as those of 3rd party providers so that their customers can get the things they need all in one place, in order to maintain customer intimacy. 
To support this transition, we have built a marketplace-as-a-service technology platform that allows anyone to create their own white label marketplace ecosystem, think of it as the ability to create your own Amazon, TaskRabbit and GoCompare all in one. 
Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for our customers to make, manage and scale their own personalised marketplace(s). And our strategy is to enable existing brands to do this, starting with a focus on financial institutions, particularly banks and the asset management industry. 
Sense  is a Personalised Digital Banking platform that enables partners to provide digital experiences that go beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to banking, instead meeting the needs of specific customer segments, connecting customers around their wants, needs and beliefs. It requires passionate and creative product-centric engineers to support this effort. 
With initiatives such as Open Banking, offering financial services is no longer restricted to just banks. We have built a platform that will also allow retail institutions to offer similar services to those previously restricted to banking partners, and by pulling retail data into our system, we can now combine data sets previously disparate to derive new insights and drive better outcomes for the end customer. 
We are unlocking an incredible opportunity to create truly personalised digital solutions for individuals and families – around the things that matter most to them – that go beyond what exists out in the market today. Every person is unique, every situation is individual, and every need is different. Our goal is to offer the platform to enable our clients to support this. 
 
What impact will you have: 
You’ll develop and maintain server-side code for one of the Product teams (Spoke or Sense), and execute on the Product vision 
You will solve complex technical problems 
Deliver value to the organisation as quickly as possible while minimising risk 
Influence decision making in the technology team 
Participate in the architecture process 
You will create and maintain features that are valuable to customers

You embrace new challenges and see them as an opportunity to grow and learn. 
You have some experience or an interest in learning to develop services using Typescript 
You will contribute to the development and improvement of the security capabilities of the Product
 
 Your skills and experience: 
Strong experience developing large-scale software products 
Solid experience in Node.JS with TypeScript for backend micro-services code

Your mission will be: 
Design, build and maintain advanced applications for the iOS platform 
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features 
Write testable, maintainable code for robustness and reliability 
Work on bug fixing and improving application performance 
Write code that directly affects users, the company and the Bitcoin ecosystem
 
 A little about you: 
Extensive experience building high quality iOS apps

But that’s not the case. Technology is about change. Not the zeros and ones. But the people, the culture and the impact it has on the world. At Red Badger we believe you cannot build successful technology without simultaneously empowering your people to embrace it. This requires change at every level. 
Red Badger was born and developed by Cain, Stu and Dave in 2010. They had a shared ambition to create a business that turned the traditional consulting model on its head: no sales team; no RFP processes, just great people doing great work that focused on quality, value and collaboration. 
The best bit about Red Badger is, of course, the team. We’ve been around for 8+ years now and we are over 100 strong. We are really proud of our people; we support and learn a lot from each other; we work really hard but have fun doing it. We are a diverse group made up of 22 different nationalities, speaking 17 different languages. 
We are based at Old Street in the heart of “tech city” and get thoroughly stuck in with the brilliant community around us. We run several meetups including the hugely popular React London, invite other groups to host their events in our office such as Lua London and Ladies Who Code and speak at events like Digital Shoreditch and LNUG.
 About the role: 
We’re looking for a Software Engineer to join our digital product delivery function. Red Badger delivers high-quality digital products using a lean delivery process and multidisciplinary, cross-functional teams. 
The work we do for our clients involves dealing with the core complexities of their business and the technology we employ varies from project to project. 
You are well on your way to having good knowledge and experience in one or more programming languages in both the frontend and backend of the stack, excited to dig deeper into the areas you already know as well as expand your skills into different languages, technologies and practices. 
You are passionate about the craft of software development and contribute to technical and non-technical discussions that help shape the direction of digital product delivery. You are able to work independently, as well as collaboratively, on user stories within an agile delivery environment and are versed in modern software delivery practices. You care about creating quality software that meets the needs of our client’s vision and goals, in a thoughtfully pragmatic way. 
As well as contributing to production-grade code bases, you will also be proactive in working directly with the client to help shape and move the project forward and, where required, helping to upskill and embed good development practices within existing, newly formed or client/Badger blended cross-functional teams. 
 
Key Responsibilities: 
Discipline Expertise: 
Working collaboratively in a cross-functional team of designers, engineers & testers 
Employ modern development practices to ship high-quality software 
Ability to adapt to new languages and frameworks

Own the delivery of user stories end-to-end working with agile principles 
Actively contribute to agile ceremonies 
Consulting with clients: 
Proactively engage with clients to shape and move the project forward

 Your experience: 
 
It’d be great if you have experience with: 
Frontend web technologies (e.g. JavaScript, Typescript, CSS, HTML, etc.) 
 
Backend technologies (e.g. Node.js, Java, Go, Rust, etc.) 
 
Effective source-control management using Git 
 
Test automation following Test Driven Development practices including unit testing, API testing, and end-to-end testing 
 
Working with lean and agile practices (e.g. Kanban, Scrum, etc.)

Work with virtualisation and orchestration tools (e.g. VMs, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.) 
 
Build, maintain and debug CI/CD pipelines (e.g. Jenkins, CircleCI, Github Actions, etc.) 
 
Make use of modern UI data layer technologies (i.e. Relay, GraphQL, Apollo, etc.) 
 
Understand, debug and help contribute to evolving cloud based architectures (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) 
 
Work with and debug data storage layer technologies (MySQL, Postgres, BigQuery etc.)

We're looking for ambitious programmers who are excited by the idea of having an instrumental impact on both our product and the environment. 
In a nutshell... 
Verdn is an API that lets companies pledge to sustainable causes with one POST call. Companies use Verdn to pledge with things like product sales (e.g. 5 trees planted with every T-shirt sold) and high-value user actions (e.g. 2kg ocean-bound plastic recovered after finishing an e-learning course). 
We also transform the post-pledge journey for our client's end-users — by giving each one of them a unique tracking dashboard where they can follow along with where, when, and how their impact happens. See an example here. 
About you 
You want your code to make a positive change to the world, and are eager to join a small, growing team where you can influence the trajectory of the product. 
You have ~3+ years' experience building web applications with React and Node, with major contributions to project planning and deployment. ️ You've created RESTful APIs using best practices, and have an understanding of how to implement SSR. 
What the job involves 
You'll have a high degree of autonomy to work on new features for our web apps (React and Next.js) and endpoints for our REST API (Node.js). 
We like to iterate on our product quickly, so you'll be part of rapid prototyping and release cycles across the stack. 
Because we're a small (but ambitious) team, you'll have a huge amount of influence on the product's direction, and an opportunity to see how the whole business works. 
We're strong believers in refactoring and performance, so you'll have time to maintain, improve, and test our different services. 
If it's a good fit for you, you are in a great position to manage others over the course of the next year as we grow our engineering team. 
P.S. There'll be time for fun, hacky things like building internal bots, creating feature ideas from experimental web technologies, and exploring technically ambitious demos. 
Our stack 
We work exclusively with TypeScript / JavaScript on both the back and front end. We use Firestore as our database. 
Our web apps include: 
Shopify app (Next.js) 
Impact-tracking dashboards (Next.js) 
API dashboard (Next.js) 
Our back end includes: 
API service (Node.js) 
Cloud functions (Node.js) 
35 days' holiday (this includes Bank Holidays). 
3 duvet days a year. 
Stock options. This is an important one to us. 
All the amenities our WeWork office has to offer. 
A MacBook and whatever other accessories you need (display, etc) in our office. 
Non-technical video call  to get to know each other and explore general fit [20 minutes] 
 
Technical video call  with Rory (CTO) where you'll be solving some Advent Of Code-style problems [45 minutes] 
 
On-site or remote interview  with both co-founders. We'll get to know each other a bit better, and there's plenty of time to answer questions about the business. Non-technical [1 hour] 
 
Technical Interview
 PART 1: Code Interview  —  We'll look at some front end (React) and back end (Node.js) code together, and do a combination of code-review, debugging and writing code [2 hours] 
PART 2: Product Interview  —  We'll explore a real-world product feature that we have shipped at Verdn and discuss how you would have chosen to design, code and ship it [1.5 hours] 
Debrief and decision.  We'll share our decision ASAP, usually within a couple of days post-interview(s)

Over 150 million people use the Lyst app and website each year to shop an assortment of 8 million items via a highly personalised experience. Lyst is a scale-up environment, combining an agile mentality with a proven business model and over a decade of experience. This provides a balance between foundations and structure, and autonomy and pace. Our goal is to be the category leading destination which every fashion shopper uses to decide what to buy. 
Data and technology sit at the heart of everything we do, and we firmly believe that we can only meet our goals by prioritising our team and culture. We give our people the freedom to drive impact and shape the future of our company, within a diverse, inclusive and high-trust environment. We don’t rely on prescriptive rules, policies and procedures to drive results. We trust the judgement and ownership of our team, and prioritise learning and career development, knowing that our success is only possible thanks to our people. Lyst was founded in London in 2010, and has raised over $160m from leading investors including Accel, Balderton, Draper Esprit, Fidelity International, and LVMH. 
We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to come and join our team, to help us build upon and improve our systems that help connect our customers who love fashion with the world’s top fashion brands. 
 
About the team: 
We maintain about half a dozen services with a team of software & machine learning engineers, data scientists and our product manager. 
We care about collecting metrics and properly monitoring our services. 
We work mostly in Python3. 
We use Docker and Kubernetes for managing our services in production. 
We use AWS Step Functions and Metaflow for managing our Data Science models. 
We use CircleCI for continuous integration and moved a lot of our services to be continuously deployed too, which is exciting! 
We work closely with other teams across tribes, and almost all of Lyst engineering uses our services. 
As a Senior Software Engineer on the Search & Rank team at Lyst, you’ll be working on one of the main teams responsible for making connections between products and our customers. We solve some unique problems at Lyst, and with the largest data catalog of fashion products you’ll be learning the best solutions as you go. We aim to build software that’s easy to maintain and low on surprises, which is a goal in many of the design approaches we’ve taken. You’ll have the opportunity for impact by building and maintaining some of the core services at Lyst. You'll be working on productionising solutions to problems involving named entity recognition, search result ranking & diversification, personalisation and recommender systems. 
 
Requirements: 
Experience with building and maintaining microservices 
Ready to contribute to an inclusive and positive working environment for everyone 
Able to communicate clearly and be humble when sharing ideas with everyone on the team 
Previous experience with data science, or an active interest in it, is a plus 
Capable of writing production quality code and doing iterative development, balancing speed to ship and long term maintainability 
Experience with the creation and maintenance of ETL pipelines is a plus 
Have a detail oriented mindset and actively demonstrate curiosity 
We make great use of both the Python and AWS data science ecosystems to power our solutions. Familiarity with Django, REST interfaces, ElasticSearch, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas and related tools would be helpful. 
If you’ve programmed in a different language and not worked with Python before, that’s OK, knowing how to code is a transferable skill. Equally if you’ve never used AWS before and have experience with an alternative cloud provider, that’s OK too. There’s time to learn on the job and a supportive, knowledgeable team will help you. We believe in having a curious mindset and your ability to learn to do the job is more important than a checklist of must haves. 
You get 29 days' time off throughout the year to take a well earned rest, in addition to the 8 public bank holidays 
The Lyst Clothing Benefit. We're a fashion company so we'll give you £250 to spend on the site in Year 1, £500 in Year 2, £750 in Year 3 and £1000 from Year 4 onwards. You're going to look fantastic! 
Private Healthcare by Vitality. Your health is important to us which is why we offer all employees a comprehensive healthcare scheme from the day that you start. 
Conferences and events. We’re big on learning, so all Lysters are allocated an individual training&development budget of £1,000.

To make well-informed investment decisions, TB clients require access to the most relevant experts, their knowledge and their expertise. Third Bridge enables this through private consultations and exclusive content drawn from interviews with industry specialists. 
Third Bridge operates in a global, multi-billion-dollar market growing double digits. Our clients consist of some of the largest private equity funds, hedge funds, mutual funds and management consulting firms, who are serviced by a team of over 1200 employees located across 7 global offices. 
 
What will you do? 
As a Principal Engineer at Third Bridge, you will support a wide range of activities and people. Taking a mentoring and facilitation mindset with your team, you encourage them to follow best practices, and deliver to best in class standards. Alongside the Head of Engineering, you’ll make sure our people have the right approach with their work, upholding a culture of engineering for test, deployment and support. 
With a ‘bigger picture’ view, you will help to shape the design and build of solutions, in line with architectural strategy. You’ll work in an Agile environment with colleagues from different disciplines across our Tech and Product department. You’ll encourage networking across the whole of Third Bridge and the wider technical community, including external third parties. 
Leading by example, you’ll support your teammates and contribute to the code base yourself. You’ll always be striving for improvements: sharing best practices; offering training opportunities; providing technical reviews; and keeping ahead of trends and technologies that can better support our business and our colleagues. 
This is a great opportunity to put your own stamp on how things are done, reducing complexity into simplicity, and helping the upskilling and transformation of the engineers around you. Third Bridge is in an exciting period of change and growth, so there’ll always be future opportunities for you to develop your skills horizontally or vertically. 
 
What will you bring? 
Working as Principal Engineer, you truly embody the ‘first amongst equals’ ethos. Your balance of technical ability and human interaction will be essential to get the best from your domain teams. 
You think pragmatically about development principles and practices, with experience in coaching, thought leadership, and driving improvements. You’re naturally curious, exploring all the options, and listening to others’ ideas and views. 
Your technical background as a senior engineer or tech lead should include: 
Clojure (You are fluent in Clojure or ClojureScript, with at least 1 year of experience with the language, and a passion for it!) 
Node.js 
JavaScript 
REACT 
PHP 
AWS experience is essential as everything is deployed in this environment. 
Equally important is your ability to build peer level relationships across the business. You’re personable and approachable, and you’re more of a coach than a teacher: supporting us to be better programers without solving it all yourself. You’ll have strategies to create a close-knit team despite the challenges of hybrid workers, and you’ll find opportunities to get us together in the London office to collaborate and socialise. 
How will you be rewarded? 
We truly care about our people so in return for your work, you’ll get: 
Flexible working - We want to encourage office attendance for the purpose of collaborating in person with your colleagues, on an as-needed basis. This in turn gives you the flexibility to decide when you come to the office based on your team's interactions. 
Hackathons 
25 days annual leave plus bank holidays, rising to 28 days after 2 years of service 
Summer Fridays - finish early during the summer months to make the most of the weather 
Mental and Professional Wellness: 
Modern Health – 6 counselling and 6 coaching sessions per year 
Talk Therapy sessions 
Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) sessions 
2 paid charity days each year 
2 personal days per year to use for events such as moving house, your birthday or life admin 
Free breakfast and snacks in the office 
Private Medical Insurance - up to family cover 
Pension contributions increasing with tenure 
Personal annual learning and development budget 
Female mentorship program 
Employee affinity groups including ESG, Environment, Mental Health, Diversity&Inclusion and Women at Third Bridge 
Life insurance - x4 base salary 
The successful candidate must, by the start of the employment, have permission to work in the country they are applying. 
We know that to be truly innovative, we need to have a diverse team around us. That is why Third Bridge is committed to creating an inclusive environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. If you are not 100% sure if you are right for the role, please apply anyway and we will be happy to consider your application. 
 
First 45 minutes will be to assess your soft skills/ people skills / culture. If you are successful with the first stage, we will give you a quick 10-minute break and then we will move on to the second part of the interview which will be the technical interview.

We're looking for ambitious programmers who are excited by the idea of having an instrumental impact on both our product and the environment. 
In a nutshell... 
Verdn is an API that lets companies pledge to sustainable causes with one POST call. Companies use Verdn to pledge with things like product sales (e.g. 5 trees planted with every T-shirt sold) and high-value user actions (e.g. 2kg ocean-bound plastic recovered after finishing an e-learning course). 
We also transform the post-pledge journey for our client's end-users — by giving each one of them a unique tracking dashboard where they can follow along with where, when, and how their impact happens. See an example here. 
About you 
You want your code to make a positive change to the world, and are eager to join a small, growing team where you can influence the trajectory of the product. 
You have ~3+ years' experience building web applications with React and Node, with major contributions to project planning and deployment. ️ You've created RESTful APIs using best practices, and have an understanding of how to implement SSR. 
What the job involves 
You'll have a high degree of autonomy to work on new features for our web apps (React and Next.js) and endpoints for our REST API (Node.js). 
We like to iterate on our product quickly, so you'll be part of rapid prototyping and release cycles across the stack. 
Because we're a small (but ambitious) team, you'll have a huge amount of influence on the product's direction, and an opportunity to see how the whole business works. 
We're strong believers in refactoring and performance, so you'll have time to maintain, improve, and test our different services. 
If it's a good fit for you, you are in a great position to manage others over the course of the next year as we grow our engineering team. 
P.S. There'll be time for fun, hacky things like building internal bots, creating feature ideas from experimental web technologies, and exploring technically ambitious demos. 
Our stack 
We work exclusively with TypeScript / JavaScript on both the back and front end. We use Firestore as our database. 
Our web apps include: 
Shopify app (Next.js) 
Impact-tracking dashboards (Next.js) 
API dashboard (Next.js) 
Our back end includes: 
API service (Node.js) 
Cloud functions (Node.js) 
35 days' holiday (this includes Bank Holidays). 
3 duvet days a year. 
Stock options. This is an important one to us. 
All the amenities our WeWork office has to offer. 
A MacBook and whatever other accessories you need (display, etc) in our office. 
Non-technical video call  to get to know each other and explore general fit [20 minutes] 
 
Technical video call  with Rory (CTO) where you'll be solving some Advent Of Code-style problems [45 minutes] 
 
On-site or remote interview  with both co-founders. We'll get to know each other a bit better, and there's plenty of time to answer questions about the business. Non-technical [1 hour] 
 
Technical Interview 
PART 1: Code Interview  —  We'll look at some front end (React) and back end (Node.js) code together, and do a combination of code-review, debugging and writing code [2 hours] 
PART 2: Product Interview  — We'll explore a real-world product feature that we have shipped at Verdn and discuss how you would have chosen to design, code and ship it [1.5 hours] 
Debrief and decision. We'll share our decision ASAP, usually within a couple of days post-interview(s)

We leverage our proprietary expertise in financial technology to identify, unlock and accelerate value for our portfolio companies and partners. We believe deeply in the power of technology to transform businesses and industries. Utilising our broad market connectivity and market leading technology capabilities we aim to be at the forefront of innovation as it emerges, delivering new capabilities into the hands of our portfolio and partners. 
Motive Create is structured across three centres of excellence: 
Services – Experts in executing due diligence, value creation planning and portfolio value creation execution 
Propositions – Drive innovation for our portfolio and partners 
Product – Build new technology assets and platforms that underpin our value creation and innovation activities 
We are currently recruiting Backend Software Engineers across two different Product teams:  Spoke  and  Sense . 
 
About the Product Teams: 
Spoke Marketplace  is forming the future of how marketplaces are used by the finance industry, and it requires passionate and creative product-centric engineers to support this effort. Our vision is to allow everyone and anyone to gain access to the products and services they need, through any channel. 
We believe that companies will move to having a marketplace business model, where they can offer both their own products and services as well as those of 3rd party providers so that their customers can get the things they need all in one place, in order to maintain customer intimacy. 
To support this transition, we have built a marketplace-as-a-service technology platform that allows anyone to create their own white label marketplace ecosystem, think of it as the ability to create your own Amazon, TaskRabbit and GoCompare all in one. 
Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for our customers to make, manage and scale their own personalised marketplace(s). And our strategy is to enable existing brands to do this, starting with a focus on financial institutions, particularly banks and the asset management industry. 
Sense  is a Personalised Digital Banking platform that enables partners to provide digital experiences that go beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to banking, instead meeting the needs of specific customer segments, connecting customers around their wants, needs and beliefs. It requires passionate and creative product-centric engineers to support this effort. 
With initiatives such as Open Banking, offering financial services is no longer restricted to just banks. We have built a platform that will also allow retail institutions to offer similar services to those previously restricted to banking partners, and by pulling retail data into our system, we can now combine data sets previously disparate to derive new insights and drive better outcomes for the end customer. 
We are unlocking an incredible opportunity to create truly personalised digital solutions for individuals and families – around the things that matter most to them – that go beyond what exists out in the market today. Every person is unique, every situation is individual, and every need is different. Our goal is to offer the platform to enable our clients to support this.

Our product is a universal API for small business financial data. We build developer-friendly infrastructure that gives businesses the ability to create their own next-generation products without sacrificing time to market. We are well-funded with a large and growing number of enterprise and fintech clients. We’ve most recently received a $10 million investment from Index Ventures, a leading global venture capital firm to help power our growth with a focus on expansion into the US. We were also awarded a £5m grant from the RBS Capability and Innovation Fund last year. 
 
About the role: 
Our engineers operate in small, focused, multidisciplinary, and highly autonomous teams of around 4 to 6 people. Our teams tend to include: 
A hands-on Lead Engineer who spends time focusing on product alignment, technical alignment, and people, as well as coding. 
A QA Engineer who represents quality throughout the team and encourages critical thinking as well as supporting automation. 
Software Engineers who help with business analysis, writing tests and code, and operating the components that the team owns. 
 Responsibilities: 
All our engineers have end-to-end responsibility. They’re involved from early on in the product design process all the way through to monitoring and operation. With this responsibility comes trust. Our engineers are empowered to use the best tool for the job. We encourage engineers to be innovative, always thinking about the best ways to give value to our clients.
 Our teams are always finding ways to make themselves more agile, and most teams use a “Scrumban” style of work, stand-ups, retrospectives, planning, and refining. Teams move rapidly, releasing at least once a day. We practise continuous integration and testing, and sometimes continuous delivery. Testing is very important to our process, and we strive for high levels of unit and end-to-end test coverage. 
Our teams are currently focusing on: 
Building high coverage for Codat's API across third-party software platforms. This includes building data formats into our financial data standard. 
Reliably and quickly processing huge amounts of financial data into our data cache and query engine. 
Building additional products on top of our core API to unlock the power of our clients' data, through the movement of data between sources, or data visualisation. 
Best in class monitoring and operations tools to allow both ourselves and our clients to find, and fix, data issues early. 
 Our Technology: 
Our system is entirely hosted on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, and is built on modern .NET Core, utilising the latest .NET features. Our system is service-based, and leverages Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage, and SQL Server to ingest and process large amounts of data reliably and efficiently. 
Requirements: 
We use a mix of technologies at Codat, but most are services supplied by Azure and leveraged using C#, we like engineers that like to keep up to date with C# and have an interest in design patterns. 
Our apps work extensively with the .NET web stack and knowledge of ASP.NET and REST APIs is really helpful. 
Clear and concise communicators; we expect Engineers to collaborate with other team members, including developers, quality assurance engineers and product stakeholders outside of Engineering. 
We have a passion for testing and working with frameworks like XUnit (or similar) to do behaviour and data driven unit tests. 
We really like engineers that are self-motivated, have a logical and systematic approach to problems solving, but understand things work best when we work as a team, are approachable, open minded, and patient. 
A lot of the problems we solve at Codat are about standardising data from various sources, this is a different set of problems to many software businesses, and we really like engineers who enjoy working with data and puzzling out problems that may not be obviously solved. A good head for financial systems helps, but isn’t necessary.

More importantly, our solution allows for fewer wasted resources and the ability to switch to more sustainable products for building, lowering the carbon footprint for every construction project. 
Building something that doesn’t exist yet takes a certain type of team and effort to create the change we want to see in the world. Our team has grown to 30+ people who are from diverse backgrounds (17 nationalities and counting). We love to be outdoors, we’re passionate about animals, sustainability and we love coffee! We have a couple of (unofficial) mascots (read: dogs) on our team who make an appearance via Slack and Zoom hangouts. 
We are constantly challenging and improving our ways of working so we can adapt to the brave new world as we continue to grow. We are searching for new innovative members for our team and want to hear your ideas on how we can be the leaders in the market and make Converge the best place to work!

That’s why here at carwow we are on a mission to change the way people buy, sell or use a car by creating the world’s best online car marketplace. We're not all petrolheads - just a highly driven (excuse the pun) scale-up with over 300 carwowers in the UK, Germany, Spain and Portugal . 
Since starting our journey in 2011, we’ve grown to become one of the most trusted comparison sites with over 12 million users and a Trustpilot rating of 4.7. We are also very proud to be backed by some of Europe’s most respected technology, marketplace and automotive investors. 
 
About the role: 
We're looking for Senior Software Engineers (Ruby on Rails) to join our growing Engineering team in the UK working in a hybrid or fully remote set up depending on your location.

Develop and test product improvements that build customer growth 
Review code to ensure that the team is following conventions and standards that are defined at carwow 
Collaborate with other engineers inside and outside of the team, helping them to do their best work and deliver projects according to our values and brand
 
 Your attributes: 
You may be just the right person if others have described you as: 
Technically experienced 
Collaborative 
Impactful
 
 Your previous experience: 
Time spent in software engineering roles is of course important, but we prioritise attitude, aptitude, and the kind of impact you’ve had over years' experience. 
Have worked as a software engineer, ideally with Ruby on Rails 
Have worked in a metrics-driven team, having a direct impact on the growth 
Are self-driven and take responsibility for product outcomes, doing whatever’s necessary to make things happen

Write code to be maintained – with good documentation, tests, and structure 
Are keen to learn continuously, share knowledge, communicate effectively and build a product in close collaboration with others
 
 How we will measure your success: 
We'll know you're doing a great job when we see: 
You’re delivering work that has measurable business impact and value to customers – early and often 
You’re a self-sufficient member of our team, actively scoping work and driving projects forward 
You’re fully engaged in the product development life cycle, helping to shape your team’s roadmap 
You're mentoring engineers on your team, providing regular feedback through code reviews and conversations 
You’re raising the bar for technical quality and sharing your expertise
 
 Working here: 
At carwow, we aim to create a culture where our team can thrive no matter where or how they work. With hybrid working (1-2 days in the office although more if you like), and a healthy home office budget of £500, we are also open to looking at alternative working patterns to ensure carwowers can work in a way that works best for them. 
We’re also a curious bunch and benefit from a number of different training opportunities. We are big on celebrating successes, working collaboratively and have found lots of ways to stay connected as a team both virtually and in person. 
With a team of over 25 different nationalities, we know a diverse and inclusive workforce creates a more innovative company. We have work to do to get us where we’d like to be, but are working hard to get there and have a number of key DE&I initiatives underway. 
So, if you always aim to WOW through everything you do (check out more info about our values here), we’d love you to join us on our journey.

Whenever you read this, we're ready to hear from you. 
Everyone deserves a job they love. Makers trains people as software engineers, helps them find that job, and then helps them thrive. You deserve a job you love. We’ve got one for you. 
Makers is a professional school for software engineers. We began as Europe’s first ‘coding bootcamp’, where career changers retrained as software developers. Since 2013 we’ve helped more than 2,000 people begin a new career in software that way. We’re one of the UK’s biggest software developer apprenticeship providers, helping people train at no cost to them, and we’re not stopping there. We partner with the UK’s most ambitious organisations to design innovative training from DevOps, to Data, Quality Engineering, Leadership, and beyond. 
We’re pretty good at what we do, according to our clients (both developers and employers), industry bodies, the press and the government. We can only get better by working with you.
 About the role: 
You want to be more than just an engineer or a manager or a teacher or a consultant: you want to help people progress in their careers at an unbelievable rate. You want to help them change their lives, to power the organisations they work with, and to make the industry and world a better place. 
As a technical coach at Makers, your role is to help people grow. You’ll join our team of software industry professionals working across all of our programmes, including: 
Immersive Engineering Training -  The core of our approach is immersive engineering training. Learners of all backgrounds join us full-time to gain modern tech engineering skills and become adaptive self-directed learners who can quickly become productive members of any dev team. Coaches run workshops, provide 1:1 support, give feedback and overall ensure that learners learn. 
 
Specialist Training -  Some of our engineers go on to study specific specialisms targeted towards their roles. For example, Quality, DevOps and SRE, Engineering Leadership, or use of specific stacks. Coaches take on the challenge of curriculum development and iteration, supported by our educational tools and ethos. Do you have a specialism you want to share? Let’s talk about it! 
 
In-Role Coaching -  The first year in the industry is an exciting and challenging experience. Our technical coaches also support on that journey to help learners navigate the team environment, and accelerate their learning. 
 
Interview Coaching -  Performing well at a technical interview can be a real test for any dev, particularly at the beginning of their career. We coach developers in taking their skills to the next level, navigating the job-hunt, and understanding what they need to demonstrate to interviewers. 
 
Curriculum Development and Innovation -  We’re on the cutting edge of technical education and are always searching for new opportunities to help people learn. No matter your path as a coach, you can expect to gain the skills not just to teach but to design highly effective educational experiences — and potentially advance the field of technical education as a whole. 
You’ll have the opportunity to work in all of these areas as a part of building your practice as an effective technical educator. You may move around to learn new educational techniques and styles, or spend time gaining in-depth expertise in one area. 
 
In all of these areas, you’ll play each of these roles: 
Coach -  Through active listening and questions, you’ll help learners reflect on their learning, their goals, the problems they are facing and the solutions they may try. 
 
Mentor -  You’ll use your own experience as a professional developer to model skills and behaviour necessary to be a dev. 
 
Technical expert -  You’ll use your technical knowledge to give expert feedback to learners as well as to help guide them towards solving their own problems. 
 
Emotional support -  The learning experience can be intense. Learners are often under a lot of stress and financial pressure. You should be there to support them and help them make the best choices they can. 
 
Education expert -  Using recognised educational tools, you’ll help the learners organise their learning, sequence material, rebuild their mental models and ultimately become independent self-learners. 
We’re building the best software engineering school in the world. We want our approach to be the foundation of how technical skills are taught everywhere. Come and be a part of it. 
 
You should: 
Have experience as a professional software engineer (any background — including Quality, SDET, QA, DevOps, Cloud, SRE, Data) 
 
Have experience helping people to grow (coaching, teaching, mentoring, tutoring, or something similar. This might be informal as part of a hobby or volunteering, or it could have been as part of a management role) 
Be comfortable talking to people (you’ll need to coach learners 1:1, as well as run workshops in front of groups of up to 30 learners) 
Be a self-led learner yourself (both to model behaviour to learners, and because our culture will need you to proactively look for information and feedback) 
Minimum holiday of 30 days including a Winter and Spring break 
Unlimited fully paid wellness leave 
Private Medical Insurance 
£500 Learning & Development allowance per annum 
Hybrid working 
Twice-weekly yoga and daily meditation sessions

About the Role: 
Our Software Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients. 
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few. 
Software Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them. 
Who We Are Looking For: 
 You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. 
You are a broadly skilled engineer, interested in developing web services and building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers. 
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making. 
You work with confidence and without ego. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. 
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. 
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

We leverage our proprietary expertise in financial technology to identify, unlock and accelerate value for our portfolio companies and partners. We believe deeply in the power of technology to transform businesses and industries. Utilising our broad market connectivity and market leading technology capabilities we aim to be at the forefront of innovation as it emerges, delivering new capabilities into the hands of our portfolio and partners. 
Motive Create is structured across three centres of excellence: 
Services – Experts in executing due diligence, value creation planning and portfolio value creation execution 
Propositions – Drive innovation for our portfolio and partners 
Product – Build new technology assets and platforms that underpin our value creation and innovation activities 
We are currently recruiting Backend Software Engineers across two different Product teams:  Spoke  and  Sense . 
 
About the Product Teams: 
Spoke Marketplace  is forming the future of how marketplaces are used by the finance industry, and it requires passionate and creative product-centric engineers to support this effort. Our vision is to allow everyone and anyone to gain access to the products and services they need, through any channel. 
We believe that companies will move to having a marketplace business model, where they can offer both their own products and services as well as those of 3rd party providers so that their customers can get the things they need all in one place, in order to maintain customer intimacy. 
To support this transition, we have built a marketplace-as-a-service technology platform that allows anyone to create their own white label marketplace ecosystem, think of it as the ability to create your own Amazon, TaskRabbit and GoCompare all in one. 
Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for our customers to make, manage and scale their own personalised marketplace(s). And our strategy is to enable existing brands to do this, starting with a focus on financial institutions, particularly banks and the asset management industry. 
Sense  is a Personalised Digital Banking platform that enables partners to provide digital experiences that go beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to banking, instead meeting the needs of specific customer segments, connecting customers around their wants, needs and beliefs. It requires passionate and creative product-centric engineers to support this effort. 
With initiatives such as Open Banking, offering financial services is no longer restricted to just banks. We have built a platform that will also allow retail institutions to offer similar services to those previously restricted to banking partners, and by pulling retail data into our system, we can now combine data sets previously disparate to derive new insights and drive better outcomes for the end customer. 
We are unlocking an incredible opportunity to create truly personalised digital solutions for individuals and families – around the things that matter most to them – that go beyond what exists out in the market today. Every person is unique, every situation is individual, and every need is different. Our goal is to offer the platform to enable our clients to support this.

We deliver purpose-built distributed ledger technology for all types of businesses in all industries. 
Developed in collaboration with our ecosystem, our enterprise blockchain platform Corda is transforming entire industries by digitalizing the processes and systems that firms rely on to connect and transact with each other. Our blockchain ecosystem is the largest in the world with more than 350 institutions deploying and building on Corda Enterprise and Corda. Our customers and partners have access to a network of leading systems integrators, cloud providers, technology firms, software vendors, corporates and banks. 
 
About the role: 
At R3 you will be at the cutting edge of distributed ledger technology (DLT). Corda is a DLT designed for running complex workflows between businesses, without any centralized points of control. You will work on a system trusted by banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges, payments companies, and others – highly demanding industries with the interesting technical challenges that come with them. 
You will join the Core Platform team to build the Corda of the future - a distributed ledger with huge throughput, reliability and uptime guarantees for the most demanding of R3 customers, and networks of customers.
 
 As part of the Core Platform team, you will: 
Work with industry-leading technologies to build out a new highly available, horizontal scaling, multi-tenant version of Corda, leveraging Kafka, working right from the bottom peer-to-peer messaging layer up to the flow engine and ledger layer Corda has become known for. 
Develop and maintain the framework and services that make up the Corda node - the flow engine, the persistence service, the certificate management service, peer-to-peer messaging gateway and more. 
Design and implement features with consideration of the availability, scalability and performance requirements of the system. 
No team is an island - you will work with many others across the company, to help ensure we build the best possible products. You will have the opportunity to showcase your work and help influence your colleagues’ thinking.
 
 About you: 
You are a highly motivated, self-sufficient software engineer with system design skills. You have a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals, either through formal study or via some other route.

You have experience or a deep interest in high availability and/or horizontal scalability of distributed systems, and are aware of or have worked with Kafka before. You may also, or alternatively, have worked with socket programming, TLS, Java NIO, Netty or similar. 
We believe the best Engineers can adapt to and learn any language, so whilst we are at heart a Kotlin shop, we welcome anyone with a strong software engineering background who wants to learn. If you have in-depth JVM knowledge, (garbage collection tuning, performance and memory profiling), and/or familiarity with the Java ecosystem that is a bonus. 
We believe that quality, security, developer experience, and operational experience are everyone’s responsibility, so you will be driven by a passion to ensure excellence in all of these. 
Depth of Expertise: Typically, 9+ years of extensive commercial experience. A blended tactical and strategic level thinker who understands clients (internal/ external) needs. Will possibly have lead a small or medium sized team at some point in their career. 
Level of Interaction: Influences the thinking of senior stakeholders and begins to proactively initiate ideas to help improve client experience. Largely self-managing.
 
 Responsibilities: 
Ownership & Responsibility: Drive the delivery whilst maintaining a coherent technical direction 
Coding and design, and assisting other Engineers with coding and design 
Utilise their subject matter expertise to take the lead over an area or component of an R3 core product

We connect and manage 100% renewable energy through the intelligent control of renewable generators, such as wind turbines and solar panels. We work closely with renewable asset owners, buying their energy and then selling it onto the UK’s grid, giving them simple access to the power market. But, the sun isn’t always shining and the wind isn’t always blowing. We must therefore capture energy for times when there is high demand. By harnessing big data and renewable technology, we accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero carbon emissions.

As an Embedded Software Engineer at Limejump you will be working on the cutting edge of energy innovation with a passionate group of developers.

Code for the smooth movement of data across our systems, ensuring that your work is clean and maintainable. 
Collaboratively determine how to build and maintain scalable backend systems. 
Participate in code reviews and commit to developing your skills as we grow. 
Develop your understanding of the energy industry and apply this to our work. 
Collaborate with other teams to keep our end-to-end pipeline scalable. 
Champion best practices, code quality and sensible architecture.
 What we need from you - Essential skills: 
Good knowledge of embedded Linux systems. 
Experience with modern C++ and Python 3.X. 
Experience in network programming with TCP/IP protocol. 
Thorough knowledge of multithreading and multiprocessing programming. 
Familiarity with AWS cloud infrastructure and services.

Other perks and Culture 
In addition to the listed benefits above, day-to-day life at Limejump is packed full of perks. There is flexibility to split your working week between home and office as well as flexible working hours to allow for balancing work with personal responsibility and circumstances. In the office we have ample comfortable breakout and booth spaces to promote a collaborative working environment.

This means harnessing data and insights to improve the efficiency of every project and provide safer working conditions for on-site teams. More importantly, our solution allows for fewer wasted resources and the ability to switch to more sustainable products for building, lowering the carbon footprint for every construction project. 
Building something that doesn’t exist yet takes a certain type of team and effort to create the change we want to see in the world. Our team has grown to 30+ people who are from diverse backgrounds (17 nationalities and counting). We love to be outdoors, we’re passionate about animals, sustainability and we love coffee! We have a couple of (unofficial) mascots (read: dogs) on our team who make an appearance via Slack and Zoom hangouts. 
We are constantly challenging and improving our ways of working so we can adapt to the brave new world as we continue to grow. We are searching for new innovative members for our team and want to hear your ideas on how we can be the leaders in the market and make Converge the best place to work! 
We are looking for a senior software engineer who values code as a craft to help us build out our digital model of the construction industry, fed with real-time data. 
At Converge you can be certain that you will work on a well-engineered codebase written by a team who cares. We value high-quality code but understand how important it is to get things done, rather than perfect. 
We deeply value collaborative work. Careful code-reviews, well-written tests, and beautifully written code ensure that our customers will get an amazing product delivered, which is safe and delightful to use.

That’s why here at carwow we are on a mission to change the way people buy, sell or use a car by creating the world’s best online car marketplace. We're not all petrolheads - just a highly driven (excuse the pun) scale-up with over 300 carwowers in the UK, Germany, Spain and Portugal . 
Since starting our journey in 2011, we’ve grown to become one of the most trusted comparison sites with over 12 million users and a Trustpilot rating of 4.7. We are also very proud to be backed by some of Europe’s most respected technology, marketplace and automotive investors. 
 
About the role: 
We're looking for Senior Software Engineers (Ruby on Rails) to join our growing Engineering team in the UK working in a hybrid or fully remote set up depending on your location.
 Senior engineers at carwow work on cross-functional product teams of product managers, engineers, designers and data analysts. You will work closely with Product Managers and Tech Leads on deciding what features to build for customers, break down and build features with the team, review code, mentor engineers, ensure operational excellence, and share knowledge broadly across the engineering organisation.

Core: 
Take part in scoping how new features can be built, and how customer needs can be met, while making pragmatic technical trade-offs 
Write maintainable and performant code, with tests and documentation 
Collaborate with your team on getting things done. Share your progress, review each other’s code and help each other out with constructive feedback 
Monitor and support your software in production by joining the on-call rotation and working to improve our site reliability

Contribute to a diverse engineering culture based on customer-centricity, high-quality code, data-driven decisions, technical innovation and business impact. 
Develop and test product improvements that build customer growth 
Review code to ensure that the team is following conventions and standards that are defined at carwow 
Collaborate with other engineers inside and outside of the team, helping them to do their best work and deliver projects according to our values and brand
 
 Your attributes: 
You may be just the right person if others have described you as: 
Technically experienced 
Collaborative 
Impactful
 
 Your previous experience: 
Time spent in software engineering roles is of course important, but we prioritise attitude, aptitude, and the kind of impact you’ve had over years' experience. 
Have worked as a software engineer, ideally with Ruby on Rails 
Have worked in a metrics-driven team, having a direct impact on the growth 
Are self-driven and take responsibility for product outcomes, doing whatever’s necessary to make things happen 
Have designed backend systems and APIs to a high standard of security, reliability and operability OR have experience building end-end websites including working on the front end 
Enjoy working in distributed teams and working cross-functionally with Product managers, designers, user researchers and other developers 
Write code to be maintained – with good documentation, tests, and structure 
Are keen to learn continuously, share knowledge, communicate effectively and build a product in close collaboration with others
 
 How we will measure your success: 
We'll know you're doing a great job when we see: 
You’re delivering work that has measurable business impact and value to customers – early and often 
You’re a self-sufficient member of our team, actively scoping work and driving projects forward 
You’re fully engaged in the product development life cycle, helping to shape your team’s roadmap 
You're mentoring engineers on your team, providing regular feedback through code reviews and conversations 
You’re raising the bar for technical quality and sharing your expertise
 
 Working here: 
At carwow, we aim to create a culture where our team can thrive no matter where or how they work. With hybrid working (1-2 days in the office although more if you like), and a healthy home office budget of £500, we are also open to looking at alternative working patterns to ensure carwowers can work in a way that works best for them. 
We’re also a curious bunch and benefit from a number of different training opportunities. We are big on celebrating successes, working collaboratively and have found lots of ways to stay connected as a team both virtually and in person. 
With a team of over 25 different nationalities, we know a diverse and inclusive workforce creates a more innovative company. We have work to do to get us where we’d like to be, but are working hard to get there and have a number of key DE&I initiatives underway. 
So, if you always aim to WOW through everything you do (check out more info about our values here), we’d love you to join us on our journey.

Did you know, the lowest 10% of earners in the UK make banks the most money in fees, charges and interest? 
Here at Wagestream, we believe that is fundamentally wrong - and we are on a mission for change! Financial Wellness is a new ""ish"" term in the software world, but we are having a big impact. We are backed by social impact charities such as Big Society Capital, and the Social Tech Trust - we are more than just a FinTech...! 
There are a lot of software buzzwords that come in and out of fashion, and we don't think Earned Wage Access is one of them, we know we are here to stay. What's the end game? Easy. Financial Wellness for everyone, everywhere. #PowerOverPay  About the role: 
When an employer signs up for Wagestream, we integrate with their payroll, HR and WFM (workforce management) systems so that we know exactly how much employees have worked and earned. Although we've done 100+ of these integrations already, each one is a little bit unique and there are many more out there. 
As part of the Integrations team, you will be at the heart of our mission, enabling people around the world to access their income as they earn it. With the support of our Sales Engineers and Delivery Managers, you will work directly with customers to integrate their systems with those of Wagestream. Every company uses slightly different terminology, jargon and data models, so the core engineering challenge is figuring out how to adapt and normalise these idiosyncrasies into a common framework, through both engineered and negotiated solutions. 
Tech Stack: AWS, Typescript, Python & Postgres. You should also have both a strong command of SQL and of cloud-based architectures.  About the team: 
The Integrations Engineering team is a small team of 5 engineers with a mixture of experienced senior engineers and enthusiastic junior engineers, who together have a significant breadth of expertise across a large range of technologies. 
The Integrations team follows a Kanban process. Each week we host a cross-functional planning session where we agree the priorities for the coming week, discuss the scope of work and resolve any ambiguities. We then run a daily stand-up in collaboration with the Delivery team where we aim to resynchronise our understanding of key priorities and resolve any blockers. The Integrations team pushes straight to production using a modern CI/CD based on GitHub Actions and AWS ECS.  Responsibilities: 
Architect, develop, test, and maintain the platform that enables us to integrate with third-party payroll, HR and WFM systems 
Bridge the gap between our Sales Engineering and Delivery units to scope integration project initiatives and work them into a successful solution 
Interface with client IT teams, where needed, to extract information and guide solutions 
Contribute within the engineering team on best practices, tools and technologies 
Ship quickly, fail sometimes, deliver constantly 
 Must-haves:
 Fluency in at least 1 major backend programming language (e.g. Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Kotlin, C#)
 Strong grasp of SQL fundamentals (we use PostgreSQL, and we don’t like ORMs) 
Experience using at least 1 cloud provider (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP) 
You like talking to people and making customers happy, and see that as one of the best parts of the job 
You are able to turn complex problems into user friendly solutions, documenting and communicating to cross-functional teams. 
You are willing to go above and beyond, guiding clients’ IT and software engineers around the best ways to get their systems integrated 
 Can-be-learnts:
 Expertise in the specific languages we use (Python, TypeScript)
 Expert-level knowledge of AWS features 
 Within 1 month you’ll have:
 Developed a good understanding of all the mechanisms we use to integrate clients 
Developed a good understanding of our System architecture, and how we make & deploy changes to it 
Started working on launching Wagestream with a new client 
 Within 3 months you’ll have:
 Launched Wagestream with  at least  1 new client
 Be able to reason fluently about our integrations architecture, and develop new features for it as required by customers
 Within 6 months you’ll:
 Be able to mentor more junior engineers, and improve their knowledge and effectiveness 
Have a complete understanding of our entire System 
Have meaningfully contributed to our technical roadmap & strategy 
We will pay you what you're worth. We are fully committed to closing the gender pay gap, promoting diversity and inclusivity, and paying people what they deserve to be paid. 
We're a Remote First business - work from home or our London office - you choose! We have team members everywhere, from Cornwall to Glasgow - we place an emphasis on finding the right people in any location, not any people in the right location. 
We will help you manage your busy lifestyle with flexible working opportunities, most of the team work ""core hours"" to allow touchpoints with your team, but we also make sure you have the time to pick the kids up at 3pm, or go for that mid-morning run to boost your productivity. We want you to have the best of both worlds. 
We offer 25 days annual leave in addition to public holidays (up to 5 day rollover), as well as flexible time off allowances for any ad-hoc childcare/family/caring needs. 
We offer 12 weeks paid maternity leave and up to 4 weeks paid paternity leave for employees with over 12 months service 
We will support you with your career endeavours. We are committed to internal progression, and offering our team members the best opportunities for growth. We want to invest in you the same way you're going to invest in us! 
If you love cycling as much as we do, keep yourself physically fit with our Evans Cycles Ride to Work scheme 
And after a long weeks work, join us in undoing it all - with membership to The Wine Society. (They also do gin and beer!) 
We want everyone to achieve ""zen mastery"" with a free subscription to Calm — work can be stressful (we know!) and we want to help you switch off 
And the best benefit of all... Free access to Wagestream service - naturally!

 Engineering track 
Developing sophisticated software to better the world. The software engineer's role is to engineer the delivery of working software that meets our client's needs. 
Sounds fancy, right? As a Software Engineer at Entelect you are responsible for more than just writing code. You will find that the process, environment, tooling and even maturity of the client’s software knowledge varies across the teams, so the Software Engineer’s job would vary too, depending on the situation. Being adaptable as a Software Engineer is very important. You will find that as you transition through different projects, teams, domains and clients, you will always be learning - and that’s part of what makes working at Entelect cool. 
 
About the role 
You must have experience with several systems and processes and be a guru at some technologies. You have enough experience that you are able to architect and structure a small project, whilst mentoring and managing others. That means you have proven that you can deal with scoping, expectation management, architecture, design and client management. Your experience allows you to seamlessly pick up new frameworks and technologies too. 
As a Senior, you'd also be expected to portray the maturity and softer skill set that Entelect Seniors are known for. Things like being able to hold others accountable, influencing change, galvanising a team and managing expectations of customers and team members are important skills for a Senior. 
Many people choose to remain as a Senior Software Engineer, or Master Craftsman as we sometimes call it, where they can code without getting involved in any of the management stuff. This a career decision that Entelect values and respects, so don't feel pressured into moving into a management role if it’s not for you. 
Our UK business is just getting started, so you'll have an opportunity to shape our identity as we grow. We have big ambitions and the support from our hugely successful South African business. 
Our UK package includes: 
Hybrid work arrangement 
Pension scheme with company contribution 
Life assurance and income protection 
Generous leave allowance 
Furthermore, you get to experience Entelect culture and all it has to offer: 
Professional and personal growth 
Training, mentorship and exposure to lots of different opportunities to experiment and learn. 
 
Project variety 
With a variety of projects using an array of technologies across various business domains, you can find work that suits you. 
 
Team-based projects 
All our projects are team-based, so you're always with other experienced people who will show you best practices and involve you in finding new and innovative ways to do things. 
 
Work with like-minded people 
Fellowship is forged with people who care about you, their craft and the hobbies you share. 
 
Tech company run by tech people 
We’re an ambitious, growing organisation without the usual nonsense and politics. 
 
Autonomy and identity 
We function as a tribe of tribes, so there’s plenty of autonomy and scope to create a different identity for each project and team. 
 
Global reach 
We’ve grown into 3 continents and we’re always looking for awesome devs, analysts, UX gurus, data engineers and scientists, architects, leaders, and more.

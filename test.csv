THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF ANAKHA’S FRESH THINKING 
 Creativity isn’t something that only senior managers do. In Digital and Innovation at Westminster City Council, we expect it from everyone, including our newest recruits. 
 Enter Anakha, a graduate trainee, full of energy and fresh ideas. We welcomed her input to our ‘Smart City’ initiatives, especially our Innovation Hub – a newly created space where staff, residents and businesses can meet, experiment and exchange ideas. 
 But it was what happened next that really made a difference. Anakha’s innovation space project was used to invite young people to help them find work through the 'Kickstarter' programme as well as to recruit young people to our 'Tech Lions' initiative and is regularly occupied by the Apprentice Community. 
 We are also inviting residents aged 11-19 from the Westminster Youth Council to the Hub to attend a fun ‘speed dating’ event, where they hear from different digital teams. We will continue to meet with them every week to keep them directly involved in our plans to ensure young people have a regular voice at the heart of the council. From the importance of electric vehicle charging points to new uses for tech, their insights about the kind of city they want to live in are central to our plans. 
 As for Anakha, she’s now moved into a permanent Project Manager role in the Digital and Innovation Smart City team. Supported by ongoing mentoring from colleagues, she’s already developing even bigger and better ideas.

A highly successful global start-up within the desirable FinTech space who are on a superhero mission - to fight fraud and financial crime through the use of AI. As a result of their unique approach and high quality work, they have grown to an organisation of over 300 people and partner with the likes of KPMG, the UK government (and more) to pioneer the fight against financial crime. 
 
This continued growth has allowed them to expand globally and they now have several offices scattered across the globe in countries such as Singapore and the United States. 
 
The Position 
 
This role will offer you the opportunity to join their highly coveted data engineering team who are currently around 30 strong. With unparalleled in-house and on-the-job training, you'll become an expert in the field and be given access to cutting edge technologies while also having the opportunity to make sideward steps into other specialisms. 
 
What can I expect to be working on? 
 
 Development of ETL pipelines 
 Entity Extraction and resolution 
 Cleansing, standardising and parsing data 
 
 What's Essential? 
 
 Extensive experience in an object orientated programming language such as Java, C++, C#, Python, R or Scala (confident enough in your own skills to undertake a coding assignment) 
 A strong academic background with a Quantitative/STEM degree 
 Demonstrable experience developing ETL pipelines 
 A desire and willingness to learn to code in Spark/Scala 
 We don't like to put too much emphasis on ""years of experience"" but this opportunity would suit a junior candidate who has already gained some commercial experience within a traditional data engineering position 
 Unfortunately this opportunity would not suit a fresh graduate 
 
 Nice to have but definitely not essential 
 
 Experience in a relevant sector either within Fraud detection or entity resolution 
 Experience in the Scala coding language 
 Knowledge of big data technologies such as Hadoop or Elasticsearch would be beneficial 
 
 What's in it for me? 
 
 A great company culture with a glass door rating of 4.85 from dozens of reviewers 
 Flexible working 
 Relocation support down the line to any of their global office locations 
 Competitive Salary of up to £50k + 10% bonus 
 Hybrid working with a Central London office location

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide. 
 
We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it. 
 
We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes. 
 
And we're just getting started. 
 
The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun. 
 
We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us. 
 
 
The Role 
 
Working as part of our analytics engineering team, your role will be to provide clean, tested, well-documented and well-modelled data sets, that will to enable and empower data scientists and business users alike, via tools like Snowflake and/or Looker. 
 
You'll work with product engineering teams to ensure modelling of source data meets downstream requirements. 
 
You will maintain and develop SQL data transformation scripts, and advise and review data scientists on data modelling to achieve denormalised and aggregated output datasets. 
 
You'll work with data scientists and other analytics engineers to surface clean, intuitive datasets in our BI tool, Looker. 
 
You will be responsible for optimisation and further adoption of Looker as a data product in the business, catering to ~1500 current active users who need to discover and interact with data. 
 
 
Skillset 
 
Required 
 
 Excellent SQL skills 
 Understanding of data warehousing, data modelling concepts and structuring new data tables 
 Good working knowledge of cloud based MPP data warehousing (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) 
 
 Desired / nice to have 
 
 Experience developing in a BI tool (Looker or similar) 
 Good practical understanding of version control 
 SQL ETL/ELT knowledge, experience with DAGs to manage script dependencies 
 Python coding skills, particularly in the areas of automation & integrations 
 Good knowledge of the Looker API 
 Good communications skills across all levels of stakeholder (business & technical) 
 An ability to break down and explain complex technical concepts to business end users 
 
 
Life at Deliveroo 
 
We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. 
 
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. 
 
 
Diversity 
 
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around."

To totally reimagine residential real estate, not only how you can improve buying and selling homes, but improving the experience of tenants with a new higher level of customer service that they’ve never had before 
Create a working experience that allows employees to astound you with their innovation, passion, and empathy for each other. 
Every member of IMMO (or our “IMMORTALS” as we call them), knows that if we are to hit these goals there’s no place for hiding behind a job description or passing the buck. We look for answers, not problems, we act, not react, we work together, not on our own, and we don’t mind failing at something new if we learn something. 
Don’t get us wrong, we aren’t perfect, there’s lots for us to improve on, lots to learn, and a heck of a lot to do. If you aren’t someone who likes the uncertainty of not knowing what the answer is, like to hog the limelight instead of sharing it, and don’t have a high level of empathy for others, then that’s fine but we are not going to be right for you. 
You Will 
Support the data science team in deploying machine learning in production 
Join a small team of data scientists working on IMMO’s core data products, playing a major part in the company’s growth. 
Define, implement, and improve the deployment infrastructure and architecture of IMMO’s data science projects to unlock the possibility to scale the reach and performance of the products to meet rapidly increasing business needs. 
Build development, testing, and production environments to further IMMO’s ability to scale up the size and speed of the data science team. 
Support IMMO’s efforts to continuously deliver new products, features, and updates by developing the necessary tooling and process to facilitate frequent automated deployments. 
Play a key role in optimising both the performance and stability of IMMO’s machine learning models to build at speed and verify changes safely. 
You Have 
Experience with dynamic programming languages such as Python (we use it both for data science and general programming). 
Production experience with AWS or GCP, including its CLI/SDK 
Production experience with Docker and either Kubernetes/ECS. 
A solid understanding of infrastructure as code principles and patterns, as well as tools like Terraform or CDK. 
Understanding of agile development methodologies and techniques. 
A proven ability to take projects from rough ideas and experiments through to robust solutions. 
A desire to work in a fast-paced environment within a close-knit team with a love of clean code. 
A passion for constantly learning new ideas and technologies, and for leveling up your skills. 
(nice to have) Experience with Node.js and/or serverless.

Benefits 
Flexible leave policy 
Flexible working policy, we believe that work is something you do not when you have to do it

React and React Native using Typescript. On the web for our accountant hub and internal dashboards, and as the backbone of our mobile app 
AWS. Not just for the basics of compute, storage and networking; we use services like Kinesis, Aurora and SNS as well 
Terraform. To tame all those AWS services across multiple environments 
Kubernetes. To orchestrate all of the services that power Countingup, we use Amazon’s EKS managed service. 
Docker containers. Our entire backend runs in a fleet of redundant, stateless containers. It can just as easily be run on a laptop when developing 
Continuous delivery. We deploy code changes multiple times a day, at the push of a button, thanks to our automated testing

The Role 
TheData Engineerwill be instrumental in establishing a data and analytics capability at Countingup. You’ll architect and build our approach to analytics, both the infrastructure to deliver it and the ways of working with it, working closely with our existing development teams. 
The Data Engineer will design the data schemas to facilitate current and future business needs, then deliver the data pipelines (ETL) to populate these, all within a cloud native environment (AWS). 
You will act as a subject matter expert on data matters, both upskilling the existing analysts and developers, as well as facilitating the future growth of the data and analytics capability. 
We’ve pulled together a lightweight, modern stack to help us deliver features quickly and resiliently: 
The Go programming language. The majority of our back end development is built using this; we like its opinionated ecosystem and small footprint 
React and React Native using Typescript. On the web for our accountant hub and internal dashboards, and as the backbone of our mobile app 
AWS. Not just for the basics of compute, storage and networking; we use services like Kinesis, Aurora and SNS as well 
Terraform. To tame all those AWS services across multiple environments 
Kubernetes. To orchestrate all of the services that power Countingup, we use Amazon’s EKS managed service. 
Docker containers. Our entire backend runs in a fleet of redundant, stateless containers. It can just as easily be run on a laptop when developing 
Continuous delivery. We deploy code changes multiple times a day, at the push of a button, thanks to our automated testing 
Key Responsibilities 
Working closely with the existing development teams, architect, build and maintain a cloud native approach to data and analytics 
Act as a subject matter expert for data and analytics across the company 
Work with other teams (Product, Compliance, Finance) to understand their needs, and ensure our approach can be evolved to meet them

And if you’re not sure whether you’re what we’re looking for - send us your CV anyway! We love to hear from people who are passionate about what we do, and we always take the view that a good cultural fit is just as important as ticking all the qualification boxes. 
What will you get in return? 
A chance to work with some great technology and tools in a challenging, fast paced environment, whilst being fully supported by a great team who you can learn from 
Exposure to every area of the business. You’ll be encouraged to get involved and make an impact on how we work

We are for everyone 
At DLUHC we value diversity and inclusion and actively encourage and welcome applications from everyone, including those that are underrepresented in our workforce. We promote equality of opportunity in all aspects of employment and a working environment free from discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation. 
We would strongly recommend that applicants get in touch with the vacancy manager to find out more information about this role. 
We are for everyone 
DLUHC want to bring in a diverse workforce at all levels. 
Our application system is designed to remove as much bias as possible from the recruitment system – this means that a hiring manager does not know your name, your details, see your whole application in one go (or have your CV at review stage unless stated otherwise). 
Your answers are randomised and chunked up. This means that each assessor views sets of responses to questions for example all candidates’ responses to ‘Seeing the Big Picture’ rather than seeing a candidate’s full application. The science behind this is that recruitment can be subject to ordering and fatigue effects and we want to reduce this as much as possible. 
Most of our campaigns utilise multiple assessors and so it is possible that each of your answers would be viewed by different assessors.

The Role 
TheData Engineerwill be instrumental in establishing a data and analytics capability at Countingup. You’ll architect and build our approach to analytics, both the infrastructure to deliver it and the ways of working with it, working closely with our existing development teams. 
The Data Engineer will design the data schemas to facilitate current and future business needs, then deliver the data pipelines (ETL) to populate these, all within a cloud native environment (AWS). 
You will act as a subject matter expert on data matters, both upskilling the existing analysts and developers, as well as facilitating the future growth of the data and analytics capability. 
We’ve pulled together a lightweight, modern stack to help us deliver features quickly and resiliently: 
The Go programming language. The majority of our back end development is built using this; we like its opinionated ecosystem and small footprint 
React and React Native using Typescript. On the web for our accountant hub and internal dashboards, and as the backbone of our mobile app 
AWS. Not just for the basics of compute, storage and networking; we use services like Kinesis, Aurora and SNS as well 
Terraform. To tame all those AWS services across multiple environments 
Kubernetes. To orchestrate all of the services that power Countingup, we use Amazon’s EKS managed service. 
Docker containers. Our entire backend runs in a fleet of redundant, stateless containers. It can just as easily be run on a laptop when developing 
Continuous delivery. We deploy code changes multiple times a day, at the push of a button, thanks to our automated testing 
Key Responsibilities 
Working closely with the existing development teams, architect, build and maintain a cloud native approach to data and analytics

We are a venture-backed Fintech and an early-stage startup with ambitious plans for growth and in order to do this we need talented, forward thinking individuals to join us. People make Countingup great.

The Role 
TheData Engineerwill be instrumental in establishing a data and analytics capability at Countingup. You’ll architect and build our approach to analytics, both the infrastructure to deliver it and the ways of working with it, working closely with our existing development teams. 
The Data Engineer will design the data schemas to facilitate current and future business needs, then deliver the data pipelines (ETL) to populate these, all within a cloud native environment (AWS). 
You will act as a subject matter expert on data matters, both upskilling the existing analysts and developers, as well as facilitating the future growth of the data and analytics capability. 
We’ve pulled together a lightweight, modern stack to help us deliver features quickly and resiliently: 
The Go programming language. The majority of our back end development is built using this; we like its opinionated ecosystem and small footprint 
React and React Native using Typescript. On the web for our accountant hub and internal dashboards, and as the backbone of our mobile app 
AWS. Not just for the basics of compute, storage and networking; we use services like Kinesis, Aurora and SNS as well 
Terraform. To tame all those AWS services across multiple environments 
Kubernetes. To orchestrate all of the services that power Countingup, we use Amazon’s EKS managed service. 
Docker containers. Our entire backend runs in a fleet of redundant, stateless containers. It can just as easily be run on a laptop when developing 
Continuous delivery. We deploy code changes multiple times a day, at the push of a button, thanks to our automated testing 
Key Responsibilities 
Working closely with the existing development teams, architect, build and maintain a cloud native approach to data and analytics 
Act as a subject matter expert for data and analytics across the company 
Work with other teams (Product, Compliance, Finance) to understand their needs, and ensure our approach can be evolved to meet them

Relevant AWS Data and Analytics certifications are desirable 
You want to help build a world-class analytics team that supports a product that makes it easier to run a small business. 
You take ownership of projects from inception to deployment 
Excellent time management, communication, and organisational skills 
Who You Are

Embrace new ideas and change 
Strive to understand customers' problems and solve them 
Possess a healthy amount of curiosity for the unknown with a growth mindset 
Take ownership of your work and deliver results 
You celebrate our wins 
And if you’re not sure whether you’re what we’re looking for - send us your CV anyway! We love to hear from people who are passionate about what we do, and we always take the view that a good cultural fit is just as important as ticking all the qualification boxes. 
What will you get in return? 
A chance to work with some great technology and tools in a challenging, fast paced environment, whilst being fully supported by a great team who you can learn from 
Exposure to every area of the business. You’ll be encouraged to get involved and make an impact on how we work

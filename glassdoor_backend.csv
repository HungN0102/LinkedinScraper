It has launched in its first incarnation to a small number of customers, but this is just the beginning, as our product evolves we aim to empower every customer to achieve financial wellness.
 
 Why do we need a Backend Developer? 
At the heart of the CMC Invest applications is our API, built on AWS using as much of AWS's broad range of technology as we need to deliver the experience our customers require. Our APIs are built to agreed contracts for both the applications that consume it and the downstream systems which it utilises. 
Our modular approach to architecture and fail fast philosophy allow us to spin up new APIs very quickly to test out new ideas or new technology. By using feature flags we can test out these new APIs in production to see if they bring the benefit we expect. If they do, great, we make them even better. If they don't, no problem. We tear it all down, document our learnings and move on to the next idea. 
Fundamentally our backend developers turn our prototypes into reality, taking on the difficult job of taking (sometimes very ambitious) requirements and turning them into real working functionality. 
We have a sack full of ambition and a backlog full of ideas to make our vision of empowering customers to financial wellness a reality and we need people to join our mission. 
 
What do we expect from a Backend Developer? 
On a daily basis, you will: 
Build APIs that are deployed into AWS which meet agreed interface contracts 
Review system designs and prototypes and work with frontend and downstream developers to create API contracts 
Evaluate new technologies that can be used to provide better customer value and experience 
Constantly monitor and improve APIs, fixing issues as soon as possible 
Provide a high-standard of documentation to enable knowledge sharing 
Have the opportunity to demonstrate the work you have done to technical and non-technical stakeholders 
Help to refine customer journeys and requirements for new features 
Work with product and design to create high-fidelity prototypes of potential new functionality 
Manage your own work, keeping boards up to date and attending standups
 
 Key Skills & Experience 
We are looking for someone that can demonstrate: 
Experience over a mix of languages and technologies, in particular JavaScript/Typescript 
Familiarity with product and design lifecycles, and collaborating closely with designers, developers, and product managers 
Experience working with frontend consumers and optimising performance 
Experience contributing and working with shared code libraries 
Passion for helping users succeed in their goals through the features you build 
Strong communication skills and an ability to take ownership of tasks and gather requirements 
Ability to solve complex coding challenges around performance and reusability while continuously improving code quality with a TDD approach 
An interest in learning new skills and collaborating on new technologies 
Source code and application versioning 
Tech stack includes: Typescript/JavaScript, Jest, AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, etc...), GitHub
 
 Useful Skills or Interests 
Any of these are a bonus, but not necessary to start the role as you'll pick it up as you go. 
Infrastructure as code (Terraform) 
Trunk based development

Our mission is a simple one, to make it easier to run a small business. 
We are a venture-backed Fintech and an early-stage startup with ambitious plans for growth and in order to do this we need talented, forward thinking individuals to join us. People make Countingup great. 
All of us here at Countingup are committed to ""The Countingup Way"" 
Do our best work 
Enjoy it 
Get it done
 
 The Role 
We are growing our Full Stack Development team and are scaling in this area considerably with the expectation of the team to double in size over the next 12 months. 
Our Full Stack Developers work in small feature teams, across our technology stack, to deliver new product features and maintain high customer satisfaction. There is no front end team, back end team or DevOps team, though individuals have expertise in these areas you can draw on. Everyone is expected, and encouraged, to work in areas as diverse as UI changes in the mobile app or code changes to configure a new AWS service. 
We’ve pulled together a lightweight, modern stack to help us deliver features quickly and resiliently: 
The Go programming language. The majority of our back end development is built using this; we like its opinionated ecosystem and small footprint 
React and React Native using Typescript. On the web for our accountant hub and internal dashboards, and as the backbone of our mobile app 
AWS. Not just for the basics of compute, storage and networking; we use services like Kinesis, Aurora and SNS as well 
Terraform. To tame all those AWS services across multiple environments 
Kubernetes. To orchestrate all of the services that power Countingup, we use Amazon’s EKS managed service. 
Docker containers. Our entire backend runs in a fleet of redundant, stateless containers. It can just as easily be run on a laptop when developing 
Continuous delivery. We deploy code changes multiple times a day, at the push of a button, thanks to our automated testing
 
 Experience & Skills 
A seasoned Developer with strong experience working in fast paced dynamic environments 
Comfortable getting to grips with unfamiliar systems and tools, as well as willing to work across multiple different programming languages 
Previous exposure to the finance or accounting industries is desirable, though not a requirement 
Happy working in a small agile team, both giving and receiving constructive feedback with your peers, but also with a fair degree of autonomy 
Able to operate in a Linux environment, use Git for version control and understand relational databases; experience with any of the tools/practices the team is currently using would be an advantage 
Passion, energy, focus and enthusiasm for both the role and our business 
Customer-focused - You should always be thinking, “What can I be doing to deliver the most value to our customers?” 
Excellent written and verbal communication skills 
We’re open to candidates with diverse backgrounds, though a degree in a technically focused subject (science, engineering) is preferable
 
 Who You Are 
We’re a sociable bunch, and we enjoy each other’s company. So it’s important that you’re a great fit for our company culture. These are just some of the things that we look for. You: 
Take pride in the work you do and everything you get involved with 
Create a positive work environment 
Strive to experiment, learn and not fear failure 
Embrace new ideas and change 
Strive to understand customers' problems and solve them 
Possess a healthy amount of curiosity for the unknown with a growth mindset 
Take ownership of your work and deliver results 
Celebrate our wins
 
 What will you get in return? 
A chance to work with some great technology and tools in a challenging, fast paced environment, whilst being fully supported by a great team who you can learn from 
Exposure to every area of the business. You’ll be encouraged to get involved and make an impact on how we work 
A transparent and open company culture where employees are consulted on company decisions and direction

Having launched the software in 2017, after years of incubation and testing, Solidatus has solidified its place as one of the most influential and critical new software solutions positioned to help the world’s largest data-rich and regulated organisations manage their processes and data. Solidatus is a multipurpose modelling, visualisation and traceability tool. It is used to model connected things in a generic and elegant way. We have developed a powerful backend which can model temporal graph structures with branching and version control to enable complex and maintainable collaboration workflows. This is exposed for technical and non-technical users through the web-based frontend where user experience takes a front row seat alongside scalability. 
About the Team 
We work with and learn from first-class engineers with outstanding computer science backgrounds, designing smart solutions to difficult visualisation problems to delight our users. We are a tight-knit team working to directly support some of the largest organisations in the world, taking pleasure in crafting elegant code with the freedom to explore new technologies. 
Role 
We are looking for first-class programmers who understand the importance of code elegance, who are deeply engaged by computer science and who are interested in many technologies. Our clients are impressive and the work you do will have a direct and significant impact on our users’ experience with Solidatus and ultimately on our success. You will be interviewed by an engineer with no BS questions. Don’t be surprised if during your interview all you do is chat about tech. We interview quickly and honestly and are able to offer positions for immediate start. 
What we’re looking for 
Solidatus is being scaled up all around the world, employing people who share our vision. We’re looking for people who align with our core values: Strength in Teamwork, Attention to the Customer and to Detail. The kind of person who wants to join a community of ambitious and kind people, all personally and professionally invested in Solidatus’ mission. If you don’t have everything we want please apply anyway. We look at all applications and are looking for potential. We are keen to help you grow and flourish and know we need to help you to achieve this too. We’re not looking for the perfect candidate and are waiting to find the best one to work with us and one that thinks that we are the best company for you too. 
What you’ll be doing 
As a full-stack engineer, you will have the opportunity to develop backend and frontend components as part of our fortnightly sprints. Some areas of focus include: the ASP.NET Core RESTful API; design and implementation of backend data storage to support fast and elegant reads and writes; designing and enabling a simple UX through a powerful UI using TypeScript and React; researching and developing new types of visualisations for connected data; supporting new sources of data loading; and enhancing the visualisation and navigation of data with support for very high volumes of data. 
Other things that keep us busy include researching and developing new solutions to existing problems faced by current users and the wider data connectivity community; communicating with users to provide support or diagnosis where a support ticket has been escalated to engineering; maintaining and improving the development workflow; and contributing to continuous improvement. 
What you’ll need 
There are a bunch of languages, frameworks and platforms that we use today but we are not duty-bound to any particular technology. We are engineers and are encouraged to use the best tool for the job. More than anything in the list below, we care about your attitude, your personability and your relationship with technology. 
You must love technology and be able to programme proficiently 
You must be an expert learner and be able to grok unfamiliar technologies fast 
Feel uncomfortable when contributions are below-par and actively promote techniques and ideas to improve our technical output 
Be able to communicate complex topics to a layperson clearly and concisely 
You must appreciate the joy of using good, elegant software 
Experience and qualifications 
Have an in-depth knowledge of JavaScript and the associated frontend technologies: NPM, Webpack, babel, TypeScript (but know when to be an early-adopter and when to wait for fads to establish) 
A UX-focused mindset is essential 
You must have a long history using software and be able to critique user interfaces 
Experience with C#, ASP.NET Core or similar is beneficial

Summary Anaconda is seeking a talented* Full Stack Developer* to join our rapidly-growing company. This is an excellent opportunity for you to leverage your experience and skills and apply it to the world of data science and machine learning. We are looking for a highly experienced web developer with a deep knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React and other relevant web development technologies, who has an interest in learning the backend technologies to become a full-stack developer working in Python and other server-side technologies. This position will be expected to perform UI and back-end development on PythonAnywhere, starting off focusing on the front end but moving to doing more back end work over time. PythonAnywhere is a platform-as-a-service used by tens of thousands of Python developers, and all members of the team work on features from the front end through to the back end. Coding is done in pairs using the Extreme Programming methodology, so the role would involve working with team members who can explain how the back end works and transfer knowledge, which over time would help the developer understand the full stack behind the system. What You'll Do:  Everyone works on complete new features and bug fixes for the entire application, from the frontend to the backend. The current team is made up of backend developers who've taught themselves front-end technology, so we look forward to welcoming someone who can teach us how to do front-end better, at the same time as we train them up on backend technologies. We practice Extreme Programming, with a two week iteration cycle. In each iteration planning meeting, we use a collaborative process to pick features to work on over the coming two weeks. A typical day: we start with a 'dogpile' on tech support from the night before, answering technical questions, user care, and so on. Then, we plan the day - who is pairing with whom, and which pairs are working on which things.. Because we do XP, it's always two programmers working on the same code at the same time, developing using test-driven development. Most of the day is spent on implementing this stuff, though there is always some time spent helping users (which then helps us understand what to do in our future iterations). We always need someone on call to deal with system outages; after some time, you would expect to be added to this rota (with a more experienced team member always available to back you up if needed).. Likewise we need a person available at weekends to be able to handle tech support, system issues, and so on. This normally takes about half a day, Saturday and Sunday, for one team member each week. Unlimited holiday enables the person in question to make up by taking a day off when working on the weekend (or two if it was busy!) Over time you would expect to be added to this rota too (again, with an experienced team member available as backup). What You Need:  Exposure to recent frameworks like Backbone.js, Bootstrap, CoffeeScript, React Fluent with git and github.com Deep curiosity for user experience and crafting products that delight Exceptional execution, obsess over the details, but pragmatic focus on delivery Experience with a geographically distributed development team Deep understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React and other modern web UI technologies. At least the last 4 years doing full-time web UI development and design Portfolio with relevant code samples - be prepared to debrief Write JavaScript, both in its raw form and with common JS libraries Capable of translating high fidelity mockups and complex requirements into quality JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for SaaS web applications Past experience in cloud SaaS UI Comfortable with a highly iterative lean/agile methodology that includes providing time estimates and managing feedback loops Driven to rigorously test and refine code to get the design right Collaboration skills to articulate your decisions, and provide and receive critical feedback Motivated self-starter with the ability to work independently Demonstrated leadership and mentoring abilities Team attitude: ""I am not done, until WE are done"" Embody our core values: Ability & Humility Innovation & Action Empathy & Connection Care deeply about fostering an environment where people of all backgrounds and experiences can flourish What Will Make You Stand Out:  Experience working in a fast-paced startup environment Experience working in a open source or data science-oriented company Why You'll Like Working Here:  Unique opportunity to translate strong open source adoption and user enthusiasm into commercial product growth Dynamic company that rewards high performers On the cutting edge of enterprise application of data science, machine learning and AI Collaborative team environment that values multiple perspectives and clear thinking Employees-first culture Flexible working hours Health and Remote working reimbursement Additional paid parental leave for fathers Pre-IPO stock options Open vacation policy and monthly company days off known as Snake Days (Minimum 42 days off) 100% remote and flexible working policy – we embrace this fully through how we operate as a company.

Two of the company’s three directors are developers — and that includes the CEO. This means that development is core to the business, developers are appreciated for their creative input, and the importance of investment in development — and avoiding technical debt — is understood. We use a cutting-edge containerised development model, that makes agile development convenient and cheap, using Dockside, our online IDE. For each new task, Dockside lets us launch a disposable development container — aka a devtainer — which provides a self-contained fully-functioning development environment running a full live NewsNow stack (talking to a disposable live database clone) complete with high-end browser-based VS Code-compatible IDE. This makes forking, staging and code-review a breeze. From conception through roll out, branches and staged developments are continuously available as needed to developers, managers and testers for collaboration, feedback and review. We run Debian Linux, Apache, MySQL with Python 3, Perl 5, and Node on the server-side, with TensorFlow/Keras for ML, and HTML5, CSS3 (SASS/SCSS) and modern JavaScript (OO ES6+ & Vue.js framework) on the client-side. All our software is containerised and deployed using Docker Swarm services on our own co-located raw metal or in Google Cloud. Our culture Open: we share and collaborate within and across departments Rigorous: We like to be clear about what we're doing, and why. Experimentation and peer-review are in our DNA One team, one vision: no office politics An appreciative environment: expect to hear ‘thanks’ a lot Room to grow: development of skills and responsibilities is encouraged and rewarded Virtual: we are today a fully-remote company with occasional in-person get-togethers Family-friendly and flexible: we understand sometimes personal needs come first Our remuneration policy NewsNow is an exceptionally stable business that values long-term relationships with its employees. As an incentive to join NewsNow, we will look to offer candidates their current market rate or above. Furthermore, we run a programme of annual (or even more frequent) appraisals and pay reviews, with the aim of ensuring our employees are motivated, fulfilled, and that their remuneration reflects and recognises their developing expertise (whether transferable skills, or knowledge of our particular stack), their value to NewsNow, and on the wider job market.

Our compact set-up lets us keep hierarchy and bureaucracy to a minimum. Which means today, we're still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact. We’re a developer-driven company. Two of the company’s three directors are developers — and that includes the CEO. This means that development is core to the business, developers are appreciated for their creative input, and the importance of investment in development — and avoiding technical debt — is understood. We use a cutting-edge containerised development model, that makes agile development convenient and cheap, using Dockside, our online IDE. For each new task, Dockside lets us launch a disposable development container — aka a devtainer — which provides a self-contained fully-functioning development environment running a full live NewsNow stack (talking to a disposable live database clone) complete with high-end browser-based VS Code-compatible IDE. This makes forking, staging and code-review a breeze. From conception through roll out, branches and staged developments are continuously available as needed to developers, managers and testers for collaboration, feedback and review. We run Debian Linux, Apache, MySQL with Python 3, Perl 5, and Node on the server-side, with TensorFlow/Keras for ML, and HTML5, CSS3 (SASS/SCSS) and modern JavaScript (OO ES6+ & Vue.js framework) on the client-side. All our software is containerised and deployed using Docker Swarm services on our own co-located raw metal or in Google Cloud. Our culture Open: we share and collaborate within and across departments Rigorous: We like to be clear about what we're doing, and why. Experimentation and peer-review are in our DNA One team, one vision: no office politics An appreciative environment: expect to hear ‘thanks’ a lot Room to grow: development of skills and responsibilities is encouraged and rewarded Virtual: we are today a fully-remote company with occasional in-person get-togethers Family-friendly and flexible: we understand sometimes personal needs come first Our remuneration policy NewsNow is an exceptionally stable business that values long-term relationships with its employees. As an incentive to join NewsNow, we will look to offer candidates their current market rate or above. Furthermore, we run a programme of annual (or even more frequent) appraisals and pay reviews, with the aim of ensuring our employees are motivated, fulfilled, and that their remuneration reflects and recognises their developing expertise (whether transferable skills, or knowledge of our particular stack), their value to NewsNow, and on the wider job market. Benefits All our positions are fully remote - work from home 100% of the time. We offer flexible working for all team members (we’re a family-friendly company) with occasional in-person meetups. Furthermore, we provide: UK-resident employees with an annual bonus, private health insurance, a competitive holiday allowance, home office equipment, and more - please ask. Non-UK-resident employees or contractors with benefits according to their location and employee status - please ask.

 We’re hiring for two Senior Backend Developers to help us build the future of late payments collection. 
 
You’ll be joining us right at the start of our development to deliver a truly unique B2B late payment technology, and we want you here for the long term with stock options. We’re looking for someone ambitious to come and own setting up Kolleno growth function – working directly with experienced founders and senior team who have worked at large international corporates (i.e. Expedia.com, Goldman Sachs). 
 
You’ll join a fast-paced team where you’ll be testing, learning, and iterating as fast as you can. We’re looking for someone data-driven and curious, who can ruthlessly prioritise and focus. You will need a strong sense of initiative. 
 About The Company 
 Our mission is to help every business to get paid on time. It is a crippling issue across all industries that nobody has managed to solve… until Kolleno arrived. 
 
We’re building the future of cash management for companies: from invoices chasing to payments reconciliation. The full cycle is done through Kolleno, promising exponential growth in the FinTech arena. 
 
We’re optimistic, hard-working, full of energy, and creative. We’re looking for like-minded people who want to be part of a once in a lifetime adventure. 
 What You’ll Be Doing 
 You will build the backend of a greenfield project, our new Kolleno product. It includes structure, design, and API endpoints to be used by the frontend team. 
 
You will write code that is vital to the company growth, by coordinating with multiple teams: founders, data science, frontend, sales, marketing, and account management in order to fully understand what the final result needs to look like. 
 
You’ll be joining a small, dynamic team. We want a real team player, who is flexible to support things that are outside of their role as you will take on more responsibility as the team grows. 
 
What We’re Looking For 
 
– 2+ years programming experience with Python 
 
– Understanding of APIs (web services) 
 
– Willingness to step forward and suggest ideas, comments, remarks 
 
– Django framework expert 
 
– Django REST Framework and AWS experience are nice to have, but we’re happy to help you with learning them on the job 
 
Technologies We Use 
 
Core Technologies: Django Rest Framework, PostgreSQL, AWS Lambda 
 
Supporting Libraries: Pandas, OAuthlib (among many others!) 
 
Testing: strong testing culture with pytest 
 
FAQ 
 
Is this a full-time role? 
 
Yes. Ideally this person would join us full time asap. 
 
Can I work remotely full-time? 
 
Everyone is currently working from the office in Mayfair. 
 
What’s the hiring process? 
 
Very simple: 
 
STAGE 1: 
 
Your first phone call will be with Ron Danenberg (Founder & CTO). 
 
– This will be to find out more about your background and introduce you to Kolleno. 
 
– We’ll want to hear about your greatest hits and why you’re proud of them. 
 
– We’ll discuss your experience in depth and explain how growth and technology will work together at Kolleno. 
 
– Duration: [20-30 mins] 
 
STAGE 2: 
 
The second stage is technical: 
 
– You will need to either: (a) do a small project at home, or (b) you will share with us an interesting repo you have on GitHub (or another version control platform). 
 
– We will then have a discussion about the code you wrote, and the technical challenges at Kolleno [45 mins]. 
 
STAGE 3: 
 
If you progress to the next stage, we will introduce you to key team members."

We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.  If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know.  You can also see our latest DE&I report  here. 
 
What you’ll be doing: 
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health. 
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped. 
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth. 
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features. 
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags. 
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas. 
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota. 
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter. 
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews. 
Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year: 
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits. 
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget. 
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users. 
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need. 
 
About you 
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide. 
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value. 
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role. 
 
What do you get for all your hard work? 
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews . You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience. 
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures 
A clear progression plan.  We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support. 
Flexibility : We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work. 
Work where you work best.  We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
 UK App access:  The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information. 
25 days annual leave a year + public holidays (+ an additional day for every year you spend at Cleo) 
 
401k matching in the US and 6% employer-matched pension in the UK 
2 months paid sabbatical after 4 years at Cleo! 
Early finish every Friday 
Online courses & internal training to level up your skills 
Regular socials and activities, online and in-person 
Online mental health support via Spill 
Access to Pushfar - online platform for external mentorship 
And many more!

STACK: Swift and Kotlin for their mobile apps. GraphQL between their apps and the backend. Backend is Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. They host with Heroku. 
SDKs YOU’LL SWEAR AT: RevenueCat (for subscriptions), MixPanel (for analytics) and Firebase (for user notifications). 
PRODUCT: iOS and Android native mobile apps that allow anyone to instantly add a second work number to any phone. Keep work separate, your personal number private, and share calls and texts with your team. 
THE JOB: Mobile Developer working on our client’s native iOS and Android apps. Competent in Swift, Kotlin, or both. 
REMOTE?: Yes, fully remote working (UK & Europe). If you’d like to work from a local co-working space, they offer a 250 GBP (350 USD) a month allowance. 
FOR YOU: Great salary (45-55k GBP / 55-70k USD depending on your experience level), 25 days off + public holidays, MacBook Pro or BYOD allowance. 
TEAM: Small but mighty experienced, there’s 14 currently (and growing fast!). 
FUTURE GOALS: They see a world with thousands of teams around the world using their app to communicate with customers and each other. On the move, in retail locations, out in the real world. 
FOUNDER: Our client is headed up by John Jackson, who has already built and sold 2 tech businesses. They are funded directly by John’s investments so are in full financial control. 
TECH PRINCIPLES: They have a mature test suite and endeavour to maintain it as part of their development process. All code changes are peer reviewed. They think the best features are a result of tight collaboration between product and engineering. They use the best tools for the job, but they need to be proven. 
DEV PROCESS: Each feature moves through product design, architecture, development, testing, and release, in a Kanban-style workflow that we manage in a tool called Shortcut. 
PRODUCT PRINCIPLES: Focus on user experience, convention over configuration, accessible to everyone, low touch high volume, no jargon. 
MUST HAVES: Commercial experience as Software Engineer (5+ years), Kotlin or Swift (competent, 3+ years), MVVM/MVVM-C (proficient), dependency injection (proficient). 
IDEALLY: GraphQL (proficient), automated testing (proficient). 
HOW THEY HIRE: With respect for your time, and transparency. First some simple technical questions, then a first interview, next a short own-time challenge that takes no more than a few hours, and then a final interview. 
TO SUM UP: Join a financially secure start up, with a grand plan, a small but experienced team, quality tech, sound technical principles, and a well-written codebase. Help millions of small and local businesses to operate, grow, and thrive. 
If this sounds like the perfect opportunity for you, our client can't wait to hear from you!

Established in 2020, we are a London-based company focused on closing the gender data gap in healthcare. Starting with the launch of our app Stella, we are helping women to manage their menopausal symptoms through personalised and evidence-based treatment plans. However, Stella is just the start of our vision. Across brain cancer, chronic pain, endometriosis and dementia there is evidence of misdiagnosis of women. Scary? Infuriating? Time for a change? We think so. 
Vira is a new company backed by leading European and US VCs. We are looking for people who are excited about being part of something big and bold from the very beginning. We are both diverse and international so flexibility is always really important to us and how we operate. We are remote-first and committed to adapting how we work to fit a variety of new and existing needs whilst embracing diverse working styles and circumstances. 
 
About your role 
We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to work with our growing Engineering team. 
As a Senior Engineer, you'll be taking an active part in planning, building and monitoring our software products. Possessing great communication skills you will have the ability to break-down problems, explain work, and relay information in a way which helps everyone move forward with a shared understanding. 
We are scaling fast and whilst the below gives you a great understanding of your role and responsibilities, you can expect to get involved in more. 
 
As the Senior Software Engineer at Vira Health, you will: 
Be heavily involved with the planning, building and monitoring of our products and features. 
Work on our consumer-facing and internal products. 
Work across our backend and frontend; confidently leading on projects that straddle the Product team. 
Develop and maintain our accessibility-first design system from the ground up. 
Collaborate with both our Designer and Researcher on user insight and work across the wider product team to enhance Stella. 
Collaborate on developing our design/engineering/product team processes. 
Have a solid understanding of tech debt and possess the ability to balance both the priorities of today with building strong foundations for the long term.
 
 We are looking for someone who: 
Has a deep understanding and significant experience of working with the following: Vue.js, Typescript, Node, Postgres, TypeORM and Jest. Bonus points if you had experience working with NestJS, Pug, Nuxt.js, Stylus, Docker, Stripe and AWS. 
Possesses great communication skills; the ability to break down problems, explain work and relay information in a way which helps everyone move forward with a shared understanding. 
Is experienced in working within a small and fast-paced team environment and whilst previous healthcare experience would be wonderful, it is definitely not a requirement. 
Comes with significant experience; this is a senior role and we are looking for someone who brings at least 4 to 6 years' worth of experience. 
Ability to design systems from scratch and take ownership of planning and delivering complex projects. 
Has an understanding of security best practices. 
Is eager to be actively involved in the whole product development process, not just your domain. We need everyone to think and problem solve like product managers. 
Has attention to detail and a desire to raise the bar.

At this time we can only offer roles to people who have the right to live and work in the UK.
 
 Our company values 
Vira is a new company and the people we are looking for are excited about being part of something big and bold from the very beginning. We have a starter-set of values that underpin everything we do. We look forward to telling you more about these. 
Serious topics deserve serious solutions. Women deserve products built on the best science and technology available. 
Good ideas can come from anywhere. Our processes encourage participation from everyone and decision making is clear and communicated. 
We have a big vision and need to move quickly. We all have specific jobs to do, but the growth and success of Vira is everyone’s responsibility. 
We exist in complex and intersecting communities. Our team and our products should reflect the diversity of the world around us. 
Work is not your entire life but it is a big part of your life. We want to create a warm and supportive environment where people have fun and excel. 
Our bar for quality is high. We are trying to do something that is really hard and really matters, and that means we expect you to perform at your best. 
We are driven, we value creative problem solving and we support our employees to make the most out of their role and stretch themselves more than they ever thought possible.

Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions. 
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in. 
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them. 
View how we run our Engineering Interview process here! https://web.meetcleo.com/blog/how-we-do-engineering-interviews-at-cleo 
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.  If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know.  You can also see our latest DE&I report  here. 
 
What you’ll be doing: 
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health. 
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped. 
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth. 
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features. 
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags. 
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas. 
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota. 
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter. 
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews. 
Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year: 
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits. 
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget. 
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users. 
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need. 
 
About you 
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide. 
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value. 
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role. 
 
What do you get for all your hard work? 
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews . You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience. 
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures 
A clear progression plan.  We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support. 
Flexibility : We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work. 
Work where you work best.  We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
 UK App access:  The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information. 
25 days annual leave a year + public holidays (+ an additional day for every year you spend at Cleo) 
 
401k matching in the US and 6% employer-matched pension in the UK 
2 months paid sabbatical after 4 years at Cleo! 
Early finish every Friday 
Online courses & internal training to level up your skills 
Regular socials and activities, online and in-person

Initial responsibility would be to work on our front -end library, which is in use across all TradingHub’s internal and external facing websites. This provides a reusable library of widgets (tables, graphs, layout components, etc) to allow our teams to rapidly build websites from reusable components. Responsibilities would cover the design of new features as well as maintenance/bugfixes. 
Our technology stack is highly innovative. We use C# in the front-end, which is transpiled to JavaScript at runtime. This allows our entire codebase (both server-side and client-side) to run from the same codebase, and is similar to Blazor in some ways. Our backend is a mix of classic relational databases, as well as a custom-designed NoSQL data store optimised for write once, read many operations. We also make heavy use of code generation to automate repetitive tasks. 
A successful candidate would spend most of their time working on the front-end and server-side components of our websites, and be comfortable enough to propose new approaches and ideas. The candidate will also be able to coordinate with internal teams who make use of our front-end library to prioritise new features, have a close relationship with our client support teams to prioritise fixes, and coordinate releases to client websites. 
 
Essential Skills/Competencies: 
Good understanding of the .NET stack, particularly C# 
Knowledge of any combination of html5/JavaScript/canvas/WebAssembly/Blazor/typescript/asm.js/Electron/CSS 
 
Ability to work independently 
Experience in financial services a bonus but not essential 
TradingHub is committed to providing equal opportunities and supporting diversity in employment. Diverse teams really are the best teams. 
 
Why should you apply? 
Ambition:  Extremely fast-growing company with an uncapped potential, offering every colleague a broad range of experience and plenty of opportunities for internal movement, as well as rapid career progression. Vibrant company culture full of uniquely talented and friendly colleagues with regular social perks to build camaraderie. 
Flexibility:  Flexible working policy (up to 3 days a week remote); 25 days holiday + bank holidays, informal dress code and excellent work/life balance. Generous maternity/parental leave policies. 
Reward:  Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus and discretionary EMI scheme (company share option scheme). 
Support:  Annual personal training budget, private healthcare, company pension plan, death in service coverage, cycle to work scheme & tech scheme. 
HR call 
Remote test (circa 1-2 hours)

We are backed by Y Combinator, the Harvard Management Company, top industry executives, and other leading Bay Area investors. 
Started by ex-computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we felt firsthand how the lack of tools to prepare quality training data was impeding the progress of building practical AI.AI feels to us like what the early days of computing or the internet must have felt like, where the potential of the technology is clear, but the tools and processes surrounding it are terrible. 
We have devised a unique methodology for automating the tasks related to preparing quality training data, in effect turning the training data problem into a data science problem.

Generous equity options 
Generous hardware budget on joining 
Flexible locationwith the opportunity to mix working in our beautiful riverside office and WFH 
A wonderful team that make coming to work a joy 
A mission that will get you out of bed every morning knowing you're doing good in the world 
We go through this process, with dropouts at each stage: 
A 30 minute role-fit and culture chat - what are you looking for, do you understand the role we're hiring for, does your background and expectations make you a potential fit for it? 
A 40 minute pair programming exercise followed by a 20 minute technical discussion to evaluate your programming ability and domain-specific experience. 
A 60 minute discussion of our system and architecture (with our code alongside), decisions we have made and may make, and their potential future impacts on our business to assess your ability to help guide our architectural choices. 
After that we'll either offer you a job, or give you a breakdown of why we don't think you're a fit for the role.

We enjoy the best of both worlds: backing from a £6bn business of highly experienced and talented individuals, and the dynamic environment of a start-up.

 The passion to create something amazing, and the mindset to learn and grow with the company.

About Webrecruit
 
We are the game changers and playmakers. We are the people who started the flat fee recruitment process back in 2001 and have worked every day since to make a difference within our sector.
 
We’ve now created our own ATS system built on cloud-based tech which provides for almost instantaneous implementation. Gone are the days of the month-long implementations, overly long builds and ground-up development of each client.
 
Our innovative system is up and running within a short time frame and rolls out new upgrades and improvements every month, which see it continually advancing.
 
To support our ground-breaking work, we’re now looking for a Backend Developer to join our team. This role is home-based and can be located anywhere in the UK.
 
 A Few Important Details: 
 Salary:  £45,000 - £50,000
 Technology Stack:  .NET, Angular/React
 
Your Day-To-Day
 
As a Backend Developer, you’ll develop and deploy new functionality, systems and products for our proprietary technology platform.
 
This is a greenfield role where you’re going to be creating new products and exciting features from the ground-up. Although we primarily work in .NET, for new projects we are open to new ideas and systems, the (blue) sky is the limit!
 
The potential from the platform is almost limitless and, although we specialise in the recruitment and HR field, as the needs and desires of our client base evolve, we will be able to meet them and innovate to continually revolutionise what we do and how it’s done.
 
 What We’ll Need From You: 
To be considered as a Backend Developer, you’ll need experience with the following:
 
 
 C#, ASP.NET, MVC, WebAPI 
 SQL and ORMs such as Entity Framework/Dapper 
 Designing and working with REST APIs 
 Source control systems such as Git or SVN 
 Working with Agile methodologies 
 
 What Would Make You Stand Out: 
Previous experience within the recruitment technology marketplace would be a huge bonus.
 
 Benefits: 
 
 You’ll discover a great range of benefits including a pension and cycle scheme 
 We’ll help you get set up, sort the kit you need and make you feel right at home…in your own home 
 
This is your chance to be involved in ground-breaking activities that are changing the face of recruitment and giving power to in-house teams whilst providing more jobs across numerous industries, more access to applications, more access to advertising solutions and new ways of thinking.
 
So, if you’re ready to be outstanding as a Backend Developer, please apply via the button shown.
 
Other organisations may call this role .NET Developer, Backend Programmer, ATS Developer, Back End Developer, .NET Backend Developer, or Web Developer."

Our mission is a simple one, to make it easier to run a small business. 
We are a venture-backed Fintech and an early-stage startup with ambitious plans for growth and in order to do this we need talented, forward thinking individuals to join us. People make Countingup great. 
All of us here at Countingup are committed to ""The Countingup Way"" 
Do our best work 
Enjoy it 
Get it done
 
 The Role 
We are growing our Full Stack Development team and are scaling in this area considerably with the expectation of the team to double in size over the next 12 months. 
Our Full Stack Developers work in small feature teams, across our technology stack, to deliver new product features and maintain high customer satisfaction. There is no front end team, back end team or DevOps team, though individuals have expertise in these areas you can draw on. Everyone is expected, and encouraged, to work in areas as diverse as UI changes in the mobile app or code changes to configure a new AWS service. 
We’ve pulled together a lightweight, modern stack to help us deliver features quickly and resiliently: 
The Go programming language. The majority of our back end development is built using this; we like its opinionated ecosystem and small footprint 
React and React Native using Typescript. On the web for our accountant hub and internal dashboards, and as the backbone of our mobile app 
AWS. Not just for the basics of compute, storage and networking; we use services like Kinesis, Aurora and SNS as well 
Terraform. To tame all those AWS services across multiple environments 
Kubernetes. To orchestrate all of the services that power Countingup, we use Amazon’s EKS managed service. 
Docker containers. Our entire backend runs in a fleet of redundant, stateless containers. It can just as easily be run on a laptop when developing 
Continuous delivery. We deploy code changes multiple times a day, at the push of a button, thanks to our automated testing
 
 Experience & Skills 
A seasoned Developer with strong experience working in fast paced dynamic environments 
Comfortable getting to grips with unfamiliar systems and tools, as well as willing to work across multiple different programming languages 
Previous exposure to the finance or accounting industries is desirable, though not a requirement 
Happy working in a small agile team, both giving and receiving constructive feedback with your peers, but also with a fair degree of autonomy 
Able to operate in a Linux environment, use Git for version control and understand relational databases; experience with any of the tools/practices the team is currently using would be an advantage 
Passion, energy, focus and enthusiasm for both the role and our business 
Customer-focused - You should always be thinking, “What can I be doing to deliver the most value to our customers?” 
Excellent written and verbal communication skills 
We’re open to candidates with diverse backgrounds, though a degree in a technically focused subject (science, engineering) is preferable
 
 Who You Are 
We’re a sociable bunch, and we enjoy each other’s company. So it’s important that you’re a great fit for our company culture. These are just some of the things that we look for. You: 
Take pride in the work you do and everything you get involved with 
Create a positive work environment 
Strive to experiment, learn and not fear failure 
Embrace new ideas and change 
Strive to understand customers' problems and solve them 
Possess a healthy amount of curiosity for the unknown with a growth mindset 
Take ownership of your work and deliver results 
Celebrate our wins
 
 What will you get in return? 
A chance to work with some great technology and tools in a challenging, fast paced environment, whilst being fully supported by a great team who you can learn from 
Exposure to every area of the business. You’ll be encouraged to get involved and make an impact on how we work

 We’re hiring for two Senior Backend Developers to help us build the future of late payments collection. 
 
You’ll be joining us right at the start of our development to deliver a truly unique B2B late payment technology, and we want you here for the long term with stock options. We’re looking for someone ambitious to come and own setting up Kolleno growth function – working directly with experienced founders and senior team who have worked at large international corporates (i.e. Expedia.com, Goldman Sachs). 
 
You’ll join a fast-paced team where you’ll be testing, learning, and iterating as fast as you can. We’re looking for someone data-driven and curious, who can ruthlessly prioritise and focus. You will need a strong sense of initiative. 
 About The Company 
 Our mission is to help every business to get paid on time. It is a crippling issue across all industries that nobody has managed to solve… until Kolleno arrived. 
 
We’re building the future of cash management for companies: from invoices chasing to payments reconciliation. The full cycle is done through Kolleno, promising exponential growth in the FinTech arena. 
 
We’re optimistic, hard-working, full of energy, and creative. We’re looking for like-minded people who want to be part of a once in a lifetime adventure. 
 What You’ll Be Doing 
 You will build the backend of a greenfield project, our new Kolleno product. It includes structure, design, and API endpoints to be used by the frontend team. 
 
You will write code that is vital to the company growth, by coordinating with multiple teams: founders, data science, frontend, sales, marketing, and account management in order to fully understand what the final result needs to look like. 
 
You’ll be joining a small, dynamic team. We want a real team player, who is flexible to support things that are outside of their role as you will take on more responsibility as the team grows. 
 
What We’re Looking For 
 
– 2+ years programming experience with Python 
 
– Understanding of APIs (web services) 
 
– Willingness to step forward and suggest ideas, comments, remarks 
 
– Django framework expert 
 
– Django REST Framework and AWS experience are nice to have, but we’re happy to help you with learning them on the job 
 
Technologies We Use 
 
Core Technologies: Django Rest Framework, PostgreSQL, AWS Lambda 
 
Supporting Libraries: Pandas, OAuthlib (among many others!) 
 
Testing: strong testing culture with pytest 
 
FAQ 
 
Is this a full-time role? 
 
Yes. Ideally this person would join us full time asap. 
 
Can I work remotely full-time? 
 
Everyone is currently working from the office in Mayfair. 
 
What’s the hiring process? 
 
Very simple: 
 
STAGE 1: 
 
Your first phone call will be with Ron Danenberg (Founder & CTO). 
 
– This will be to find out more about your background and introduce you to Kolleno. 
 
– We’ll want to hear about your greatest hits and why you’re proud of them. 
 
– We’ll discuss your experience in depth and explain how growth and technology will work together at Kolleno. 
 
– Duration: [20-30 mins] 
 
STAGE 2: 
 
The second stage is technical: 
 
– You will need to either: (a) do a small project at home, or (b) you will share with us an interesting repo you have on GitHub (or another version control platform). 
 
– We will then have a discussion about the code you wrote, and the technical challenges at Kolleno [45 mins]. 
 
STAGE 3: 
 
If you progress to the next stage, we will introduce you to key team members."

Having launched the software in 2017, after years of incubation and testing, Solidatus has solidified its place as one of the most influential and critical new software solutions positioned to help the world’s largest data-rich and regulated organisations manage their processes and data. 
Solidatus is a multipurpose modelling, visualisation and traceability tool. It is used to model connected things in a generic and elegant way. We have developed a powerful backend which can model temporal graph structures with branching and version control to enable complex and maintainable collaboration workflows. This is exposed for technical and non-technical users through the web-based frontend where user experience takes a front row seat alongside scalability. 
This is an incredibly exciting time to join Solidatus. In 2020 alone, we announced our strategic investment from Citi, entered Gartner’s prestigious Magic Quadrant and were awarded ‘Best Data Governance Solution’ by the A-Team. We were also recognised by FinTech Global’s RegTech100, chosen to support the FCA’s Digital Sandbox Pilot and maintained an ‘100% would recommend’ rating on Gartner Peer Insights. Our team has more than tripled in size since the start of the year, collectively supporting in these achievements. 2021 will see us expand into new territories and sectors, continuing at the same rate of growth, and further disrupting the market with our unique, lineage-first solution ... and we’re just getting started! 
 
About the Team 
We work with and learn from first-class engineers with outstanding computer science backgrounds, designing smart solutions to difficult visualisation problems to delight our users.

We enjoy what we do!

We are looking for first-class programmers who understand the importance of code elegance, who are deeply engaged by computer science and who are interested in many technologies. 
Our clients are impressive and the work you do will have a direct and significant impact on our users’ experience with Solidatus and ultimately on our success. You will be interviewed by an engineer with no BS questions. Don’t be surprised if during your interview all you do is chat about tech. We interview quickly and honestly and are able to offer positions for immediate start. 
 What we’re looking for? 
Solidatus is being scaled up all around the world, employing people who share our vision. We’re looking for people who align with our core values: Strength in Teamwork, Attention to the Customer and to Detail.
 The kind of person who wants to join a community of ambitious and kind people, all personally and professionally invested in Solidatus’ mission.

 Designing and enabling a simple UX through a powerful UI using TypeScript and React

Our mission is a simple one, to make it easier to run a small business. 
We are a venture-backed Fintech and an early-stage startup with ambitious plans for growth and in order to do this we need talented, forward thinking individuals to join us. People make Countingup great. 
All of us here at Countingup are committed to ""The Countingup Way"" 
Do our best work 
Enjoy it 
Get it done
 
 The Role 
We are growing our Full Stack Development team and are scaling in this area considerably with the expectation of the team to double in size over the next 12 months. 
Our Full Stack Developers work in small feature teams, across our technology stack, to deliver new product features and maintain high customer satisfaction. There is no front end team, back end team or DevOps team, though individuals have expertise in these areas you can draw on. Everyone is expected, and encouraged, to work in areas as diverse as UI changes in the mobile app or code changes to configure a new AWS service. 
We’ve pulled together a lightweight, modern stack to help us deliver features quickly and resiliently: 
The Go programming language. The majority of our back end development is built using this; we like its opinionated ecosystem and small footprint 
React and React Native using Typescript. On the web for our accountant hub and internal dashboards, and as the backbone of our mobile app 
AWS. Not just for the basics of compute, storage and networking; we use services like Kinesis, Aurora and SNS as well 
Terraform. To tame all those AWS services across multiple environments 
Kubernetes. To orchestrate all of the services that power Countingup, we use Amazon’s EKS managed service. 
Docker containers. Our entire backend runs in a fleet of redundant, stateless containers. It can just as easily be run on a laptop when developing 
Continuous delivery. We deploy code changes multiple times a day, at the push of a button, thanks to our automated testing
 
 Experience & Skills 
A seasoned Developer with strong experience working in fast paced dynamic environments 
Comfortable getting to grips with unfamiliar systems and tools, as well as willing to work across multiple different programming languages 
Previous exposure to the finance or accounting industries is desirable, though not a requirement 
Happy working in a small agile team, both giving and receiving constructive feedback with your peers, but also with a fair degree of autonomy 
Able to operate in a Linux environment, use Git for version control and understand relational databases; experience with any of the tools/practices the team is currently using would be an advantage 
Passion, energy, focus and enthusiasm for both the role and our business 
Customer-focused - You should always be thinking, “What can I be doing to deliver the most value to our customers?” 
Excellent written and verbal communication skills 
We’re open to candidates with diverse backgrounds, though a degree in a technically focused subject (science, engineering) is preferable
 
 Who You Are 
We’re a sociable bunch, and we enjoy each other’s company. So it’s important that you’re a great fit for our company culture. These are just some of the things that we look for. You: 
Take pride in the work you do and everything you get involved with 
Create a positive work environment 
Strive to experiment, learn and not fear failure 
Embrace new ideas and change 
Strive to understand customers' problems and solve them 
Possess a healthy amount of curiosity for the unknown with a growth mindset 
Take ownership of your work and deliver results 
Celebrate our wins
 
 What will you get in return? 
A chance to work with some great technology and tools in a challenging, fast paced environment, whilst being fully supported by a great team who you can learn from 
Exposure to every area of the business. You’ll be encouraged to get involved and make an impact on how we work

Every day, we fight for the world’s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions. 
Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, we’ve reached over 4 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in. 
We’re looking for a brilliant senior backend Ruby engineer to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. You’ll be joining a team of adaptable, creative and product-focused engineers who ship working software. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them. 
View how we run our Engineering Interview process here! https://web.meetcleo.com/blog/how-we-do-engineering-interviews-at-cleo 
We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, parents, carers, and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.  If there’s anything we can do to accommodate your specific situation, please let us know.  You can also see our latest DE&I report  here. 
 
What you’ll be doing: 
Joining a cross-functional product squad with a mix of backend engineers, data analysts, frontend engineers, user researchers, designers, UX writers and others to develop features that improve our users ’financial health. 
Collaborating with other leaders in your squad and pillar to provide technical insight into upcoming feature work, and leading the delivery of work by helping pull everyone together to get it shipped. 
Mentoring your colleagues to help them become the best engineers they can be. You intentionally take time to share your skills and experiences with them and actively support their growth. 
Working on our Ruby on Rails monolith to build out data models, background workers, JSON apis, and business logic services to support those product features. 
Delivering your work wrapped in the tools and techniques we use to let us iterate quickly: tests, observability, AB-tests and feature flags. 
Analysing data, wherever you might find it—querying our postgresql database, investigating our application logs, monitoring our stats and performance metrics, or digging into our quantitative user research data—to detect problems and come up with new ideas. 
Supporting your colleagues by joining our in-hours support rota, and, optionally, joining our compensated out-of-hours on-call rota. 
Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the backend chapter. 
Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews. 
Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of product feature work our engineers have taken part in over the last year: 
Building a secured credit card from scratch to help our users improve their credit scores without changing their habits. 
Launching our new budget rewind feature to help users understand their pay-cycle and provide them with better analysis of how they got on with their budget. 
Adding discount plans and tiering options to our subscriptions so we can experiment with the best pricing for different types of users. 
Whichever squad and part of the business you land in, you will ship changes multiple times a day to our hundreds of thousands of active users and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need. 
 
About you 
Firstly and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide. 
You’ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value. 
As this is a SE3-SE4 position we’re looking for someone who has strong industry experience of using Ruby on Rails for a minimum of 4 years. If it’s not quite that much, maybe you want to look at our standard Backend role, and if it’s much less you should look at our Graduate role. 
 
What do you get for all your hard work? 
A competitive compensation package (base + equity) with bi-annual reviews . You can view our public progression framework and salary bandings here: https://cleo-ai.progressionapp.com/engineering- This position is a SE3-SE4 level and we can pay£63,292-£96,792 p.a depending on experience. 
Work at one of the fastest-growing tech startups, backed by top VC firms, Balderton & EQT Ventures 
A clear progression plan.  We want you to keep growing. That means trying new things, leading others, challenging the status quo and owning your impact. Always with our complete support. 
Flexibility : We can’t fight for the world’s financial health if we’re not healthy ourselves. We work with everyone to make sure they have the balance they need to do their best work. 
Work where you work best.  We’re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we’d love you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office. If you’re outside of London, we’ll encourage you to spend a couple of days with us a few times per year. And we’ll cover your travel costs, naturally.
 UK App access:  The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK (but only until next year). If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US–where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future. Check out this page for more information. 
25 days annual leave a year + public holidays (+ an additional day for every year you spend at Cleo) 
 
401k matching in the US and 6% employer-matched pension in the UK 
2 months paid sabbatical after 4 years at Cleo!

As the Transformation team, we work alongside MOO’s other engineering teams to help them adopt the mindset and the skills they need for the next major iteration of MOO’s ecommerce platform. We’re selecting the tools and writing the software that’ll form the foundations for MOO’s future. 
At this stage in our journey we’re increasingly focused on user experience so we’re looking for a Senior Front End Engineer. The right candidate will have experience with frameworks and languages like React, GraphQL, CSS-in-JS and Typescript and be happy to work alongside our existing FE Senior within our wider cross functional team.
 
 The Role 
We’re a warm and supportive group who are enthusiastic about new technologies, open collaboration and learning as we go. If that sounds like the sort of group you’d like to be a part of and you’ve a gentle, ego-free outlook, then we’d love the chance to talk with you.
 
 The person we want 
MOO’s engineering teams have long since hit their stride when it comes to remote working. If you prefer, we also have an attractive drop-in office in central London where you’ll find colleagues from across the business to chat with.
 
 Responsibilities 
Be part of an autonomous Build & Run team that’s pivotal to MOO’s future 
Design, implement and support resilient systems that are cloud based, geographically distributed and work at scale 
Take a key role in MOO’s Front End community as we set out new principles and practices for the future 
Flex or acquire skills in areas like AWS, Terraform and Datadog as you play your part in supporting the underlying platform 
Develop highly performant, usable, and accessible mobile-first user interfaces with React and Next.js on Netlify, using static-site, server-side and client-side rendering when appropriate 
Guide the architectural evolution of the frontend through well encapsulated micro-frontends 
Build and maintain backend-for-frontends using Typescript, Next.js on Netlify, GraphQL and other technologies to connect business domain HTTP+JSON APIs to a clean, modern ecommerce user experience
 
 About you 
You're an experienced Front End focused engineer who’s more excited than fearful when adopting new tech (but a few butterflies are still OK!) 
You love to evangelise for new technology adoption and love to share knowledge with other teams or business stakeholders 
You solve problems as part of a team but keep yourself accountable 
You’re commercially minded and user focused
 
 What’s it like to work at MOO? 
MOO’s the kind of workplace where you can really be yourself. Dye your hair purple. Hit the sofa with your laptop. Whatever helps you feel comfortable and happy at work. We want to help you grow in your career and set you up for success – while also recognising the importance of a healthy work/life balance. 
That’s why we offer 25 days holiday rising by one day for each year here (for 5 years), a matched pension scheme, MOO’s share option scheme, and paid parental leave. We’ll offer you private healthcare, life insurance, a season ticket loan, subsidised gym membership and a cycle to work scheme. While most of us are currently working from home due to COVID-19 we can't wait to get back into the office where we like to treat our employees to breakfast and fresh fruit every day, lunch on Fridays and all the ice cream you can eat (just watch for the brain freeze). 
 
Diversity Statement 
We are working hard to create a representative, inclusive and super-friendly team, because we know that different experiences, perspectives and backgrounds make for a better workplace. And that creates a better experience for our customers. MOO doesn’t discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion or belief, gender, national origin, age, sexual orientation, marital status, disability or any other protected class.
